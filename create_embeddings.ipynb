It is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony.[1] The 1st Academy Awards were held in 1929.[5] The second ceremony, in 1930, was the first one broadcast by radio. The 1953 ceremony was the first one televised.[1] It is the oldest of the four major annual American entertainment awards. Its equivalents – the Emmy Awards for television, the Tony Awards for theater, and the Grammy Awards for music – are modeled after the Academy Awards.[6] The Oscar statuette depicts a knight, rendered in the Art Deco style.[7]\\n \\n History \\n [edit] The first Academy Awards presentation was held on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner function at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, with an audience of about 270 people.[8]\\n The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.[9][1] The cost of guest tickets for that night\\'s ceremony was $5 - $89 at 2023 prices. Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors, and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927–28 period. The ceremony ran for 15\\xa0minutes.\\n For this first ceremony, winners were announced to the media three months earlier.[10] For the second ceremony in 1930, and the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00\\xa0pm on the night of the awards.[1] In 1940, the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began. As a result, in 1941 the Academy started using a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners.[1]\\n The term \"Oscar\" is a registered trademark of the AMPAS. In the Italian language, it is used generically to refer to any award or award ceremony, regardless of which field.[11][12]\\n \\n Milestones \\n [edit] The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jann'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Academy_Awards.txt'}, page_content=\"]\\n \\n Milestones \\n [edit] The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings, for his performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh. As he had to return to Europe before the ceremony, the Academy agreed to give him the prize early, making him the first Academy Award recipient. For the first Awards, winners were recognized for multiple films during the qualifying period; Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred , and Janet Gaynor won the first Best Actress award for performances in three films. Beginning with the second ceremony, performers received separate nominations for individual films; no performer has received multiple nominations in the same category since the 3rd Academy Awards. \\n For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period ran from 1 August to 31 July. The 6th Academy Awards' eligibility ran from 1 August 1932 to 31 December 1933, and as of the 7th Academy Awards, subsequent eligibility periods have matched the calendar year (with the exception of the 93rd Academy Awards, which, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, extended the eligibility period to 28 February 2021).[1]\\n Best Foreign Language Film, now known as Best International Feature Film, was introduced at the 20th Academy Awards as a special award, and became a competitive category at the 29th Academy Awards.\\n The 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[13]\\n Since 1973, all Academy Awards ceremonies, except for 2021, have ended with the Academy Award for Best Picture. Traditionally, the previous year's winners for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor present the awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively, while the previous year's winners for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress present the awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. In recent years, this has been replaced by each acting award being introduced by five previous winners, each of whom introduces one of the nominated performances.\\n On February 9, 2020, Parasite became the first foreign-language film to win Best Picture at the 92nd Academy Awards.[14]\\n The 93rd Academy Awards ceremony, honoring the best films of 2020 and early 2021, was held on April 25, 2021, after it was postponed from its original February 28, 2021, schedule due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema.

It took place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California for the 19th consecutive year, along with satellite location taking place at the Union Station also in Los Angeles.[15] Because of the virus impact on films and TV industries, Academy president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson announced that for the 2021 Oscar Ceremony, streaming movies with a previously planned theatrical release were eligible.[16] The theatrical requirement was reinstated starting with the 95th Academy Awards.[17]\\n \\n Oscar statuette \\n [edit] \\n Overview \\n [edit] §\\xa0Categories The Oscar statuette, officially the Academy Award of Merit,[18] is given to winners of each year's awards. Made of gold-plated bronze on a black metal base, it is 13.5\\xa0in (34.3\\xa0cm) tall, weighs 8.5\\xa0lb (3.856\\xa0kg), and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes. The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.[19]\\n  (ru) Sculptor George Stanley, who also did the Muse Fountain at the Hollywood Bowl, sculpted Cedric Gibbons' design. The statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold-plated solid bronze. Within a few years, the bronze was abandoned in favor of Britannia metal, a pewter-like alloy which is then plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally, 24-karat gold.[18] Due to a metal shortage during World War II, Oscars were made of painted plaster for three years. Following the war, the Academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold-plated metal ones.[20]\\n The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W. Shumway & Sons Foundry in Batavia, Illinois, which also contributed to casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Award statuettes. From 1983 to 2015,[21] approximately 50 Oscars in a tin alloy with gold plating were made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer R.S. Owens & Company.[22] It would take between three and four weeks to manufacture 50 statuettes.[23]\\n In 2016, the Academy returned to bronze as the core metal\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Academy_Awards.txt'}, page_content=' 50 statuettes.[23]\\n In 2016, the Academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes, handing manufacturing duties to Walden, New York–based Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry, now owned and operated by UAP Urban Art Projects.[24][25] While based on a digital scan of an original 1929 Oscar, the statuettes retain their modern-era dimensions and black pedestal. Cast in liquid bronze from 3D-printed ceramic molds and polished, they are then electroplated in 24-karat gold by Brooklyn, New York–based Epner Technology. The time required to produce 50 such statuettes is roughly three months.[26] R.S. Owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the Academy, and service existing Oscars that need replating.[27]\\n \\n Naming \\n [edit] The origin of the nickname of the trophy has been disputed, as multiple people have taken credit for naming the trophy \"Oscar\".\\n Margaret Herrick, librarian and president of the Academy, may have said she named it after her supposed uncle Oscar in 1921.[a] The only corroboration was a 1938 clipping from the Los Angeles Examiner, in which Herrick told a story of her and her husband joking with each other using the phrase, \"How\\'s your uncle Oscar\".[28]\\n Bette Davis, in her 1962 autobiography, claimed she named it in 1936 after her first husband, Harmon Oscar Nelson, of whom the statue\\'s rear end reminded her.[28][29] But the term had been in use at least two years before. In a 1974 biography written by Whitney Stine with commentary from Davis, Davis wrote \"I relinquish once and for all any claim that I was the one — so, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the honor is all yours\".[28][30]\\n Columnist Sidney Skolsky wrote in his 1970 memoir that he came up with the term in 1934 under pressure for a deadline, mocking Vaudeville comedians who asked \"Will you have a cigar, Oscar?\" The Academy credits Skolsky with \"the first confirmed newspaper reference\" to Oscar in his column on March 16, 1934, which was written about that year\\'s 6th Academy Awards.[31] But in the newspaper clipping that Skolsky referred to, he wrote that \"these statues are called \\'Oscars\\'\", meaning that the name was already in use.[28]\\n Bruce Davis, a former executive director of the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Academy_Awards.txt'}, page_content=' that the name was already in use.[28]\\n Bruce Davis, a former executive director of the Academy, credited Eleanore Lilleberg, a secretary at the Academy when the award was first introduced, for the nickname. She had overseen the pre-ceremony handling of the awards. Davis credits Lilleberg because he found in an autobiography of Einar Lilleberg, Eleanore\\'s brother, that Einar had referenced a Norwegian army veteran named Oscar that the two knew in Chicago, whom Einar described as having always \"stood straight and tall\".[28][32] He asserts credit \"should almost certainly belong to\" Lilleberg.[32]\\n In 2021, Brazilian researcher Dr. Waldemar Dalenogare Neto found the probable first public mention of the name \"Oscar\", in journalist Relman Morin\\'s \"Cinematters\" column in the Los Angeles Evening Post-Record on December 5, 1933. Since the awards didn\\'t take place that year, he said: \"What\\'s happened to the annual Academy banquet? As a rule, the banquet and the awarding of \"Oscar\", the bronze statuette given for best performances, is all over long before this\". This information changes the version of Sidney Skolsky as the first to publicly mention the name.[33]\\n \\n Engraving \\n [edit] To prevent information identifying the Oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony, Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates. Until 2010, winners returned their statuettes to the Academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective Oscars. Since 2010, winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governor\\'s Ball, a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony. The R.S. Owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony, bearing the name of every potential winner. The nameplates for the non-winning nominees are later recycled.[34][35]\\n \\n Ownership of Oscar statuettes \\n [edit] Prior to 1950, Oscar statuettes were, and remain, the property of the recipient.[36] Since then the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that the statuette be first offered for sale back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards predating this agreement have been sold'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Academy_Awards.txt'}, page_content='ulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards predating this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.[37]\\n In 1989, Michael Todd\\'s grandson tried to sell Todd\\'s Best Picture Oscar for his 1956 production of Around the World in 80 Days to a movie prop collector. The Academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract by gaining a permanent injunction against the sale.\\n In 1992, Harold Russell consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for The Best Years of Our Lives to auction to raise money for his wife\\'s medical expenses. Though his decision caused controversy, the first Oscar ever to be sold passed to a private collector on August 6, 1992, for $60,500 ($131,400 today). Russell defended his action, saying, \"I don\\'t know why anybody would be critical. My wife\\'s health is much more important than sentimental reasons. The movie will be here, even if Oscar isn\\'t\".[38]\\n In December 2011, Orson Welles\\' 1941 Oscar for Citizen Kane (Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay) was put up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy.[39] On December 20, 2011, it sold in an online auction for US$861,542 ($1,166,900 today).[40]\\n Some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury.[37]\\n \\n Other awards presented by the Academy \\n [edit] §\\xa0Special categories In addition to the Academy Award of Merit (Oscar award), there are nine honorary (non-competitive) awards presented by the Academy from time to time (except for the Academy Honorary Award, the Technical Achievement Award, and the Student Academy Awards, which are presented annually):[41]\\n Governors Awards:\\nThe Academy Honorary Award (annual) (which may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette);\\nThe Irving G.

Prior to that, the results were announced in early February. In 2021, the nominees were announced in March. In 2022, the nominees were announced in early February for the first time since 2003.\\n \\n Voters \\n [edit] The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 9,487 as of 2022[update].[42][43]\\n Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. As of 2022[update], actors constitute the largest bloc, numbering 1,359 (14.1% of the voting body).[43] Votes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, and its predecessor Price Waterhouse, since the 7th Academy Awards in 1935.[44][45][46] In May 2011, the Academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting would be implemented in 2013, replacing mailed paper ballots.[47]\\n All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination, or an existing member may submit a name, based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures.\\n New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join.[48]\\n In 2012, the results of a study conducted by the Los Angeles Times were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88% of AMPAS' voting membership. Of the 5,100+ active voters confirmed, 94% were Caucasian, 77% were male, and 54% were found to be over the age of 60. 33% of voting members are former nominees (14%) and winners (19%).\"),\n",

The film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run, with at least one of the daily showings starting between 6\\xa0pm and 10\\xa0pm local time.[50][51]\\n For example, the 2009 Best Picture winner, The Hurt Locker, was originally first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the 2008 awards, as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the 2009 awards. Foreign films must include English subtitles. Each country can submit only one film for consideration in the International Feature Film category per year.[52]\\n Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40\\xa0minutes, except for short-subject awards. It must exist either on a 35 mm or 70 mm film print, or in 24\\xa0frame/s or 48\\xa0frame/s progressive scan digital cinema format, with a minimum projector resolution of 2,048 by 1,080 pixels.[53] Since the 90th Academy Awards, presented in 2018, multi-part and limited series have been ineligible for the Best Documentary Feature award. This followed the win of O.J.: Made in America, an eight-hour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on ABC and ESPN, in that category in 2017. The Academy's announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film.[32]\\n The Best International Feature Film award does not require a U.S. release. It requires the film to be submitted as its country's official selection.\\n The Best Documentary Feature award requires either week-long releases in both Los Angeles County and any of the five boroughs of New York City during the previous calendar year,[b] or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the Document\"),\n",

A film must have been reviewed by a critic from The New York Times, Time Out New York, the Los Angeles Times, or LA Weekly.[55]\\n Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline. In case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year. The form includes the production credits for all related categories. Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases.\\n Awards in short film categories (Best Documentary Short Subject, Best Animated Short Film, and Best Live Action Short Film) have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards. First, the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year, instead covering one year starting on October 1, and ending on September 30 of the calendar year before the ceremony. Second, there are multiple methods of qualification. The main method is a week-long theatrical release in either New York City or Los Angeles County during the eligibility period. Films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of several competitive film festivals designated by the Academy, also without regard to prior public distribution.[55][56]\\n A film that is selected as a gold, silver, or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous Student Academy Awards is also eligible (Documentary category for that award, and Animation, Narrative, Alternative, or International for the other awards). The requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards. Only one screening per day is required. For the Documentary award, the screening must start between noon and 10\\xa0pm local time. For other awards, no specific start time is required, but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times.[55][56]\\n In late December, ballots, and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6,000 active members. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories, i.e. only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc. In the special case of Best Picture\"),\n",

In all major categories, a variant of the single transferable vote is used, with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees (ten for Best Picture) ranked preferentially.[57][58][59] In certain categories, including International Feature Film, Documentary and Animated Feature, nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches.\\n In most categories, the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members.[57][59] Since 2009, the Best Picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting.[59][60] Since 2013, re-weighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the Best Visual Effects.[61]\\n Film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for Best Picture, in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in Oscar season. The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified. It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders.[62] For example, a producer of the 2009 Best Picture nominee The Hurt Locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front-runner. The Hurt Locker eventually won.\\n \\n Academy Screening Room \\n [edit] The Academy Screening Room or Academy Digital Screening Room is a secure streaming platform which allows voting members of the Academy to view all eligible films (except, initially, those in the International category) in one place. It was introduced in 2019, for the 2020 Oscars. DVD screeners and Academy in-person screenings were still provided. For films to be included on the platform, the North American distributor must pay $12,500, including a watermarking fee, and a digital copy of the film to be prepared for streaming by the Academy. The platform can be accessed via Apple TV and Roku players.[63][64] The watermarking process involved several video security firms, creating a forensic watermark and restricting the ability to take screenshots or screen recordings.[65]\\n In 2021, for the 2022 Oscars, the Academy banned all physical screeners and in-person screenings, restricting official membership viewing'),\n",

Films eligible in the Documentary and International categories were made available in different sections of the platform. Distributors can also pay an extra fee to add video featurettes to promote their films on the platform.[66] The in-person screenings were said to be cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[67] Eligible films do not have to be added to the platform, but the Academy advertises them to voting members when they are.[66]\\n \\n Awards ceremonies \\n [edit] List of Academy Awards ceremonies \\n Telecast \\n [edit]  31st Academy Awards Hollywood Pantages Theatre  81st Academy Awards Dolby Theatre  95th Academy Awards Dolby Theatre The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. Black tie dress is the most common outfit for men. Fashion may dictate not wearing a bow-tie, and musical performers are sometimes not required to adhere to this. The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.\\n The Academy Awards is the world's longest-running awards show televised live from the United States to all time zones in North America and worldwide, and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.[68] The Oscars were first televised in 1953 by NBC, which continued to broadcast the event until 1960, when ABC took over, televising the festivities, including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966, to 1970. NBC regained the rights for five years (1971–75), then ABC resumed broadcast duties in 1976 and its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028.[69]\\n The Academy has produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets, especially those outside of the Americas, in more desirable local timeslots. The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Academy_Awards.txt'}, page_content=\" American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries. In 1980, the rights were sold to 60 countries, and by 1984, the television rights to the Academy Awards were licensed in 76 countries.\\n In 2004, the ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February, to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with Oscar season in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing television ratings success coinciding with the NCAA division I men's basketball tournament, which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. In 1976 and 1977, ABC's regained Oscars were moved from Tuesday to Monday and went directly opposite the national championship game on NBC. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February sweeps period.[70]\\n Some years, the ceremony is moved into the first Sunday of March to avoid a clash with the Winter Olympic Games. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of Passover and Easter, which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public.[70] Advertising is somewhat restricted, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. As of 2020, the production of the Academy Awards telecast held the distinction of winning one the highest number of Emmys in history, with  54 wins and 280 nominations overall.[71]\\n After many years of being held on Mondays at 6:00\\xa0p.m. Pacific/9:00\\xa0pm Eastern, since the 1999 ceremonies, it was moved to Sundays at 5:30\\xa0pm PT/8:30\\xa0pm ET.[72] The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier.[73] For many years the film industry opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.[74]\\n In 2010, the Academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing television viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season. However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers, as opposed to traditionally\"),\n",

Furthermore, a January ceremony on Sunday would clash with National Football League (NFL) playoff games.[75] In 2018, the Academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late February to mid-February beginning with the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020.[76] In 2024, the ceremony was moved to an even earlier start time of 4:00\\xa0pm PT/7:00\\xa0p.m. ET, the apparent impetus being the ability for ABC to air a half-hour of primetime programming as a lead-out program at 7:30\\xa0p.m. PT/10:30\\xa0p.m. ET.[77]\\n Originally scheduled for April 8, 1968, the 40th Academy Awards ceremony was postponed for two days, because of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. On March 30, 1981, the 53rd Academy Awards was postponed for one day, after the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington, D.C.[78]\\n In 1993, an In Memoriam segment was introduced,[79] honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months, a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members.[80] This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names. Criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect, with the segment having a \"popularity contest\" feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject\\'s cultural impact. The applause has since been muted during the telecast, and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead. This segment was later followed by a commercial break.\\n In terms of broadcast length, the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours. The first Oscars, in 1929, lasted 15\\xa0minutes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twenty-three minutes.[81][82] In 2010, the organizers of the Academy Awards announced winners\\' acceptance speeches must not run past 45\\xa0seconds. This, according to organizer Bill Mechanic, was to ensure the elimination of what he termed \"the single most hated thing on the show\" – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion.[83] In 2016, in a further effort to streamline speeches, winners\\' dedications were displayed on an on-screen ticker.[84]'),\n",

The 88th Academy Awards were the lowest-rated in the past eight years (although with increases in male and 18–49 viewership), while the show itself also faced mixed reception. Following the show, Variety reported that ABC was, in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the Oscars, seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself. Currently and nominally, AMPAS is responsible for most aspects of the telecast, including the choice of production staff and hosting, although ABC is allowed to have some input on their decisions.[87] In August 2016, AMPAS extended its contract with ABC to 2028: the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives ABC any further creative control over the telecast.[88]\\n \\n TV ratings \\n [edit] Historically, the telecast's viewership is higher when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture award. More than 57.25\\xa0million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 70th Academy Awards in 1998, the year of Titanic, which generated a box office haul during its initial 1997–98 run of US$600.8\\xa0million in the US, a box-office record that would remain unsurpassed for years.[89] The 76th Academy Awards ceremony, in which The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368\\xa0million) received 11 Awards, including Best Picture, drew 43.56\\xa0million viewers.[90] The most-watched ceremony based on Nielsen ratings to date, was the 42nd Academy Awards (Best Picture Midnight Cowboy), which drew a 43.4% household rating on April 7, 1970.[91] Hoping to rein\"),\n",

The 78th Academy Awards, which awarded a low-budget independent film (Crash with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4\\xa0million) generated an audience of 38.64\\xa0million with a household rating of 22.91%.[93] In 2008, the 80th Academy Awards telecast was watched by 31.76\\xa0million viewers on average with an 18.66% household rating, the lowest-rated and least-watched ceremony at the time, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards.[94] The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film (this time, the Coen brothers's No Country for Old Men).\\n  [95] Whereas the 92nd Academy Awards drew an average of 23.6\\xa0million viewers,[96] the 93rd Academy Awards drew an even lower viewership of 10.4\\xa0million,[97] the lowest viewership recorded by Nielsen since it started recording audience totals in 1974.[98] The 94th and 95th editions drew 16.6 and 18.7\\xa0million viewers, respectively, still below the audience of the 92nd edition.[99][100]\\n \\n Archive \\n [edit] The Academy Film Archive holds copies of every Academy Awards ceremony since the 1949 Oscars, as well as material on many prior ceremonies, along with ancillary material related to more recent shows. Copies are held in a variety of film, video and digital formats.[101]\\n \\n Venues \\n [edit] In 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. From 1930 to 1943, the ceremony alternated between two venues: the Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard and the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.\\n Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The 21st Academy Awards in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theatre at what had been the Academy's headquarters on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood.[102]\\n From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood's Pantages Theatre\"),\n",

With the advent of television, the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York, first at the NBC International Theatre (1953) and then at the NBC Century Theatre, after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles. In 1961, the Oscars moved to the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica, California. In 1969, the Academy moved the ceremonies back to Downtown Los Angeles, to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Music Center. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the ceremony returned to the Shrine Auditorium.\\n In 2002, Hollywood's Dolby Theatre, previously known as the Kodak Theatre, became the presentation's current venue.[103]\\n \\n Categories \\n [edit] \\n Current categories \\n [edit] In the first year of the awards, the Best Directing award was split into two categories, Drama and Comedy. At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories, Drama and Comedy/Musical. From the 1930s to the 1960s, the Art Direction (now Production Design), Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were split into two categories (black-and-white films and color films). Prior to 2012, the Production Design award was called Art Direction, while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup.\\n In August 2018, the Academy announced that several categories would not be televised live, but recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony.[105]\\nFollowing dissent from Academy members, they announced that they would air all 24 categories live. This followed several proposals, among them, the introduction of a Popular Film category, that the Academy had announced but did not implement.[106]\\n \\n Discontinued categories \\n [edit] \\n Proposed categories \\n [edit] The Board of Governors meets each year and considers new award categories.

William Friedkin, an Academy Award–winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as \"the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself\".[115]\\n Tim Dirks, editor of AMC\\'s Filmsite, has written of the Academy Awards:\\n Unfortunately, the critical worth, artistic vision, cultural influence and innovative qualities of many films are not given the same voting weight. Especially since the 1980s, moneymaking \"formula-made\" blockbusters with glossy production values have often been crowd-pleasing titans (and Best Picture winners), but they haven\\'t necessarily been great films with depth or critical acclaim by any measure.[116] A recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the Oscar season is the whisper campaign. These campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those who were involved in creating the movie. Examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against Zero Dark Thirty suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that Lincoln distorts history.[117]\\n \\n Accusations of bias \\n [edit] Oscar bait Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics, biographical dramas, romantic dramedies and family melodramas, most of'),\n",

The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded. The term \"Oscar bait\" was coined to describe such movies. This has led, at times, to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g., by favoring \"Oscar bait\" over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.[118]\\n Despite the success of The Dark Knight, the film did not receive a Best Picture nomination at the 81st Academy Awards. This decision received substantial criticism and was described as a \"snub\" by many publications.[119][120][121] The backlash to the decision was such that, for the 82nd Academy Awards awards in 2010, the Academy increased the limit for Best Picture nominees from five to ten, a change known as \"The Dark Knight Rule\".[122][123][124][121]\\n \\n Allegations of a lack of diversity \\n [edit] The Academy Awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees.[125][126][127] This criticism is based on the statistics from every Academy Awards since 1929, which show that only 6.4% of Academy Award nominees have been non-white and since 1991, 11.2% of nominees have been non-white, with the rate of winners being even more polarizing.[128] For a variety of reasons, including marketability and historical bans on interracial couples, a number of high-profile Oscars have been given to yellowface portrayals, as well as performances of Asian characters rewritten for white characters.[129][130] It took until 2023 for an Asian woman to win an Academy Award for Best Actress, when Michelle Yeoh received the award for her performance in Everything Everywhere All at Once. The 88th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott, popularized on social media with the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, based on activists\\' perception that its all-white acting nominee list reflected bias.[131] In response, the Academy initiated \"historic\" changes in membership by 2020.[132][133] Some media critics claim the Academy\\'s efforts to address its purported racial, gender and national biases are merely distractions.[134][135][136][137] By contrast, the Golden Globe Awards already have multiple winners of Asian'),\n",

This has led to situations where a film has two or more co-leads, and one of these is submitted in a supporting category to avoid the two leads competing against each other, and to increase the film\\'s chances of winning. This practice has been derisively called \"category fraud\".[141][142]\\n For example, Rooney Mara was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for Carol (2015), despite her having a comparable amount of screentime to Cate Blanchett, who was nominated for Best Actress. Another example is Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), where Brad Pitt was nominated for and won Best Supporting Actor, even though he played an equally important role to Best Actor nominee Leonardo DiCaprio. In both these cases, critics argued that The Weinstein Company, the studio behind the former film, had placed someone who was actually a leading actor or actress into the supporting categories to avoid them competing against their co-lead.[141][142]\\n \\n Symbolism or sentimentalization \\n [edit] Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity,[143] to make up for a \"snub\" for a work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one awarded, or presented as a \"career honor\" to recognize a distinguished nominee\\'s entire body of work.[144]\\n \\n Recognition of streaming media film \\n [edit] Following the 91st Academy Awards in February 2019 in which the Netflix-broadcast film Roma had been nominated for ten awards including the Best Picture category, Steven Spielberg and other members of the Academy discussed changing the requirements through the Board of Governors for films as to exclude those from Netflix and other media streaming services.

Spielberg had been concerned that Netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than for typical Oscar-winning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than for other Best Picture-nominated films, while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical-run status to qualify for an Oscar.[145]\\n The United States Department of Justice, having heard of this potential rule change, wrote a letter to the Academy in March 2019, cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti-trust concerns against the Academy.[146] Following its April 2019 board meeting, the Academy Board of Governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for Oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs.[147]\\n \\n 2022 Chris Rock and Will Smith slapping incident \\n [edit] Chris Rock–Will Smith slapping incident During the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, Chris Rock joked about Jada Pinkett Smith\\'s shaved head[148] with a G.I. Jane reference. Will Smith walked onstage and slapped Rock across the face, then returned to his seat and told Rock, twice, to \"Keep my wife\\'s name out [of] your fucking mouth!\"[149][150][151] While later accepting the Best Actor award for King Richard, Smith apologized to the Academy and the other nominees, but not to Rock.[152][153][154] Rock decided not to press charges against Smith.[155]\\n On April 8, 2022, the Academy made an announcement via a letter sent by president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson informing the public that Will Smith had received a ten-year ban from attending the Oscars as a result of the incident.[156]\\n \\n Refusals of the award \\n [edit] Some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars. The first to do so was screenwriter Dudley Nichols (Best Writing in 1935 for The Informer). Nichols boycotted the 8th Academy Awards ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers\\' Guild.[157] Nichols eventually accepted the 1935 award three years later, at the 1938 ceremony. Nichols was nominated for three further Academy Awards during his career.\\n George C.

Hondo (1953) – Removed from the Best Story ballot after letters from the producer and nominee questioned its inclusion in the category. High Society (1955) – Withdrawn from screenwriting ballot after being mistaken for the 1956 movie of the same title. The Godfather (1972) – Initially nominated for eleven awards, its nomination for Best Original Score was revoked after it was discovered that its main theme was very similar to music that the score\\'s composer had written for an earlier film. None of its other nominations were revoked, and it received three Oscars, including Best Picture. A Place in the World (1992) – Removed from the Best Foreign Language Film ballot after it was discovered that the country which submitted the film exercised insufficient artistic control. Alone Yet Not Alone (2014) – The film\\'s title song, \"Alone Yet Not Alone\", was removed from the Best Original Song ballot after Bruce Broughton was found to have improperly contacted other members of the Academy\\'s musical branch; this was the first time that a film was removed from a ballot for ethical reasons. 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (2017) – Sound mixer Greg P.

One film was disqualified after winning the award, and had the winner return the Oscar:\\n Young Americans (1969) – Initially won the award for Best Documentary Feature, but was later revoked after it was revealed that it had opened theatrically prior to the eligibility period. One film had its nomination revoked after the award ceremony when it had not won the Oscar:\\n Tuba Atlantic (2011) – Its nomination for Best Live Action Short Film was revoked when it was discovered that the film had aired on television in 2010, before its theatrical release. \\n Remarks about animated films as children\\'s genre \\n [edit] At the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed Disney princess characters in live-action remakes of their respective animated films: Lily James (Cinderella), Naomi Scott (Aladdin), and Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid). While introducing the category, Bailey stated that animated films are \"formative experiences as kids who watch them,\" as James put it, \"So many kids watch these movies over and over, over and over again.\" Scott added: \"I see some parents who know exactly what we\\'re talking about.\"[168] The remarks were heavily criticized by animation fans and those working in the animation industry as infantilizing the medium and perpetuating the stigma that animated works are strictly for children, especially since the industry was credited with sustaining the flow of Hollywood content and revenue during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Phil Lord, co-producer of one of the nominated films, The Mitchells vs. the Machines, tweeted that it was \"super cool to position animation as something that kids watch and adults have to endure.\" The film\\'s official social media accounts responded to the joke with an image reading: \"Animation is cinema.\"[169][170] A week later, Lord and his producing partner Christopher Miller wrote a guest column in Variety criticizing the Academy for the joke and how Hollywood has treated animation, writing that \"no one set out to diminish animated films, but it\\'s high time we set out to elevate them.\" They also suggested to the Academy that the category should be presented by a filmmaker who respects the art of animation as cinema.[171]\\n Adding to the controversy was that the award for Best Animated Short Film (the nominees for which were mostly made up of shorts not aimed at children) was one of the eight categories that were not presented during the live broadcast.[172] The winner for'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Academy_Awards.txt'}, page_content=' was one of the eight categories that were not presented during the live broadcast.[172] The winner for the Best Animated Short award was The Windshield Wiper, a multilingual Spanish-American film which is adult animated, while another nominee in three categories: Best Animated Feature, Best Documentary Feature Film, and Best International Feature Film, was Flee, a PG-13 rated animated documentary about an Afghan refugee. Alberto Mielgo, director of The Windshield Wiper, later gave an acceptance speech for the Oscar: \"Animation is an art that includes every single art that you can imagine. Animation for adults is a fact. It\\'s happening. Let\\'s call it cinema. I\\'m very honored because this is just the beginning of what we can do with animation.\"[173] Some speculations suggested that the speech played a role in the decision not to broadcast the award.[174]\\n Another factor is that numerous animated films have been made for mature audiences or with ranges of PG-13 or more, with a few of them —The Triplets of Belleville, Persepolis, Chico and Rita, The Wind Rises, Anomalisa, My Life as a Courgette, The Breadwinner, Loving Vincent, Isle of Dogs, I Lost My Body, and Flee— having been nominated in this category, with The Boy and the Heron being the first adult animated film (in this case, PG-13-rated) to win in the 96th Academy Awards.[175][176]\\n These comments came as #NewDeal4Animation, a movement of animation workers demanding equal pay, treatment and recognition alongside their contemporaries working in live-action, was picking up momentum during negotiations for a new contract between The Animation Guild, IATSE Local 839/SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers,[177] and the presentation is being used to rally the movement.\\n During the 96th Academy Awards in 2024, host Jimmy Kimmel said, \"Please raise your hand if you let your kid fill out this part of the ballot.\" These remarks would again prompt backlash, with Christopher Miller, producer of that year\\'s nominated Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, tweeting out that the joke was \"tired and lazy\".[178] The PG-13-rated The Boy and the Heron would subsequently win the award.\\n \\n Associated events \\n [edit] The following events are closely associated with the annual Academy Awards:\\n Governors Awards, which include the presentation'),\n",

In recent years, these gifts have been extended to award nominees and winners.[183] The value of each of these gift bags can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars. In 2014, the value was reported to be as high as US$80,000.[184] The value has risen to the point where the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status.[185]\\n Oscar gift bags have included vacation packages to Hawaii and Mexico and Japan, a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant, videophones, a four-night stay at a hotel, watches, bracelets, spa treatments, bottles of vodka, maple salad dressing, weight-loss gummie candy and up to $25,000 worth of cosmetic treatments and rejuvenation procedures such as lip fillers and chemical peels from New York City facial plastic surgeon Konstantin Vasyukevich.[183][186][187][188][189] Some of the gifts have even had a \"risque\" element to them; in 2014, the adult products retailer Adam & Eve had a \"Secret Room Gifting Suite\".

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content='\\n   A People\\'s History of the United States is a 1980 nonfiction book (updated in 2003) by American historian and political scientist Howard Zinn. In the book, Zinn presented what he considered to be a different side of history from the more traditional \"fundamental nationalist glorification of country\".[1] Zinn portrays a side of American history that can largely be seen as the exploitation and manipulation of the majority by rigged systems that hugely favor a small aggregate of elite rulers from across the orthodox political parties.\\n A People\\'s History has been assigned as reading in many high schools and colleges across the United States.[2] It has also resulted in a change in the focus of historical work, which now includes stories that previously were ignored.[1] The book was a runner-up in 1980 for the National Book Award. It frequently has been revised, with the most recent edition covering events through 2002. In 2003, Zinn was awarded the Prix des Amis du Monde Diplomatique for the French version of this book Une histoire populaire des États-Unis.[3] More than two million copies have been sold.\\n In a 1998 interview, Zinn said he had set \"quiet revolution\" as his goal for writing A People\\'s History. \"Not a revolution in the classical sense of a seizure of power, but rather from people beginning to take power from within the institutions. In the workplace, the workers would take power to control the conditions of their lives.\"[4] In 2004, Zinn edited a primary source companion volume with Anthony Arnove, entitled Voices of a People\\'s History of the United States.\\n A People\\'s History of the United States has been criticized by various pundits and fellow historians. Critics, including professor Chris Beneke and Randall J. Stephens,[5] assert blatant omissions of important historical episodes, uncritical reliance on biased sources, and failure to examine opposing views.[6][7] Conversely, others have defended Zinn and the accuracy and intellectual integrity of his work.[8][9][10]\\n \\n Overview \\n [edit] In a letter responding to a 2007 critical review of his A Young People\\'s History of the United States (a release of the title for younger readers) in The New York Times Book Review, Zinn wrote:\\n My history ... describes the inspiring struggle of those who have fought slavery and racism (Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, Fannie Lou Hamer, Bob Moses), of the labor organizers who have led strikes'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=' Lloyd Garrison, Fannie Lou Hamer, Bob Moses), of the labor organizers who have led strikes for the rights of working people (Big Bill Haywood, Mother Jones, César Chávez), of the socialists and others who have protested war and militarism (Eugene V. Debs, Helen Keller, the Rev. Daniel Berrigan, Cindy Sheehan). My hero is not Theodore Roosevelt, who loved war and congratulated a general after a massacre of Filipino villagers at the turn of the century, but Mark Twain, who denounced the massacre and satirized imperialism.[11][12]\\nI want young people to understand that ours is a beautiful country, but it has been taken over by men who have no respect for human rights or constitutional liberties. Our people are basically decent and caring, and our highest ideals are expressed in the Declaration of Independence, which says that all of us have an equal right to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" The history of our country, I point out in my book, is a striving, against corporate robber barons and war makers, to make those ideals a reality—and all of us, of whatever age, can find immense satisfaction in becoming part of that.[13] \\n Columbus to independence \\n [edit] Chapter 1, \"Columbus, the Indians, and Human Progress\" covers early Native American civilization in North America and the Bahamas, the enslavement committed by the crew of Christopher Columbus (whom Zinn accused of genocide), and incidents of violent colonization by early settlers. Instead of restating the same history that has been presented for centuries, Zinn states that he prefers to tell history from the perspective of the Arawaks, which many people are not familiar with. He describes the purpose of Columbus\\' expedition and his brutality towards the natives after his arrival. Not only does he use firsthand account of witnesses to Columbus\\' presence in the islands, he also provides statistics of native casualties to present this different side of history. Topics include the Arawaks, Bartolomé de las Casas, the Aztecs, Hernán Cortés, Pizarro, Powhatan, the Pequot, the Narragansett, Metacom, King Philip\\'s War, and the Iroquois.\\n Chapter 2, \"Drawing the Color Line\" addresses the slave trade and servitude of poor White people in the Thirteen Colonies. Zinn writes of the methods by which he says racism was created artificially in order to'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=' Colonies. Zinn writes of the methods by which he says racism was created artificially in order to enforce the economic system. He argues that racism is not natural because there are recorded instances of camaraderie and cooperation between enslaved Blacks and White servants in escaping from and in opposing their subjugation.\\n Chapter 3, \"Persons of Mean and Vile Condition\" describes Bacon\\'s Rebellion (1676), the economic conditions of the poor in the colonies, and opposition to their poverty. Zinn uses Nathaniel Bacon\\'s rebellion to assert that \"class lines hardened through the colonial period\".[14]\\n Chapter 4, \"Tyranny Is Tyranny\" covers the movement for \"leveling\" (economic equality) in the colonies and the causes of the American Revolution. Zinn argues that the Founding Fathers agitated for war to distract the people from their own economic problems and to stop popular movements, a strategy that he claims the country\\'s leaders would continue to use in the future.\\n Chapter 5, \"A Kind of Revolution\" covers the war and resistance to participating in war, the effects on the Native American people, and the continued inequalities in the new United States. When the land of veterans of the Revolutionary War was seized for non-payment of taxes, it led to instances of resistance to the government, as in the case of Shays\\' Rebellion. Zinn notes that \"Charles Beard warned us that governments—including the government of the United States—are not neutral ... they represent the dominant economic interests, and ... their constitutions are intended to serve these interests.\"[15][page\\xa0needed]\\n \\n Independence to the robber barons \\n [edit] Chapter 6, \"The Intimately Oppressed\" describes resistance to inequalities in the lives of women in the early years of the U.S. Zinn tells the stories of women who resisted the status quo, including Polly Baker, Anne Hutchinson, Mary Dyer, Amelia Bloomer, Catharine Beecher, Emma Willard, Harriot Kezia Hunt, Elizabeth Blackwell, Lucy Stone, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Margaret Fuller, Sarah Grimké, Angelina Grimké, Dorothea Dix, Frances Wright, Lucretia Mott, and Sojourner Truth.\\n If you look through high school textbooks and elementary school textbooks in American history, you will find Andrew Jackson the frontiersman, soldier, democrat, man of the people—not Jackson the slaveholder, land speculator, executioner of dissident soldiers, exterminator of Indians'),\n",

Zinn writes that President James Polk agitated for war for the purpose of imperialism. Zinn argues that the war was unpopular, but that some newspapers of that era misrepresented the popular sentiment.[17]\\n Chapter 9, \"Slavery Without Submission, Emancipation Without Freedom\" addresses slave rebellions, the abolition movement, the Civil War, and the effect of these events on African-Americans. Zinn writes that the large-scale violence of the war was used to end slavery instead of the small-scale violence of the rebellions because the latter may have expanded beyond anti-slavery, resulting in a movement against the capitalist system. He writes that the war could limit the freedom granted to African-Americans by allowing the government control over how that freedom was gained.\\n Chapter 10, \"The Other Civil War\", covers the Anti-Rent movement, the Dorr Rebellion, the Flour Riot of 1837, the New York City draft riots, the Molly Maguires, the rise of labor unions, the Lowell girls movement, and other class struggles centered around the various depressions of the 19th century. He describes the abuse of government power by corporations and the efforts by workers to resist those abuses.[18][19]\\n Chapter 11, \"Robber Barons and Rebels\" covers the rise of industrial corporations such as the railroads and banks and their transformation into the nation\\'s dominant institutions, with corruption resulting in both industry and government. Also covered are the popular movements and individuals that opposed corruption, such as the Knights of Labor, Edward Bellamy, the Socialist Labor Party, the Haymarket martyrs, the Homestead strikers, Alexander Berkman, Emma Goldman, Eugene V. Debs, the American Railway Union, the Farmers\\' Alliance, and the Populist Party.\\n \\n The 20th century \\n [edit] Chapter 12, \"The Empire and the People\", covers American imperialism during the Spanish–American War and the Philippine'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=', \"The Empire and the People\", covers American imperialism during the Spanish–American War and the Philippine–American War, as well as in other lands such as Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico. The Teller Amendment is discussed. Zinn portrays the wars as racist and imperialist and opposed by large segments of the American people.\\n Chapter 13, \"The Socialist Challenge\", covers the rise of socialism and anarchism as popular political ideologies in the United States. Covered in the chapter are the American Federation of Labor (which Zinn argues provided too exclusive of a union for non-white, female, and unskilled workers; Zinn argues in Chapter 24 that this changes in the 1990s), Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), Mary Harris \"Mother\" Jones, Joe Hill, the Socialist Labor Party, W. E. B. Du Bois, and the Progressive Party (which Zinn portrays as driven by fear of radicalism).\\n Chapter 14, \"War Is the Health of the State\" covers World War I and the anti-war movement that happened during it, which was met with the heavily enforced Espionage Act of 1917. Zinn argues that the United States entered the war in order to expand its foreign markets and economic influence.\\n Chapter 15, \"Self-Help in Hard Times\" covers the government\\'s campaign to destroy the IWW, and the factors leading to the Great Depression. Zinn states that, despite popular belief, the 1920s were not a time of prosperity, and the problems of the Depression were simply the chronic problems of the poor extended to the rest of the society. Also covered is the Communist Party\\'s attempts to help the poor during the Depression. He criticizes some aspects of Franklin Delano Roosevelt\\'s New Deal: \"From the first, the NRA was dominated by big business and served their interests.\"[20] According to Zinn, the New Deal was aimed mainly at stabilizing the economy and \"secondly at giving enough help to the lower classes to keep them from turning a rebellion into a real revolution\".[21]\\n Chapter 16, \"A People\\'s War?\", covers World War II, opposition to it, and the effects of the war on the people. Zinn, a veteran of the war himself, notes that \"it was the most popular war the US ever fought\",[22] but states that this support may have been manufactured through the institutions of American society. He cites various instances of opposition to fighting (in some cases greater than those during World War I) as proof. Z'),\n",

Zinn also argues that the US\\'s true intention was not fighting against systematic racism, since the US had this itself, such as with the Jim Crow laws (leading to opposition to the war from African-Americans). In accordance with American revisionist historian Gar Alperovitz, another argument made by Zinn is that the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not necessary, as the U.S. government had already known that the Japanese were considering surrender beforehand, and it was \"most anxious to get the Japanese affair over with before the Russians got in\".[23] Other subjects from WWII covered include Japanese American internment and the bombing of Dresden. The chapter continues into the Cold War, which Zinn writes was used by the U.S. government to increase control over the American people (for instance, eliminating such radical elements as the Communist Party) and at the same time create a state of permanent war, which allowed for the creation of the military–industrial complex. Zinn believes this was possible because both conservatives and liberals willingly worked together in the name of anti-Communism. Also covered is US involvement in the Greek Civil War, the Korean War, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the Marshall Plan and the Cuban Revolution.\\n Chapter 17, \"\\'Or Does It Explode?\\'\" (named after a line from Langston Hughes\\'s poem \"Harlem\" from \"Montage of a Dream Deferred\", referred to as \"Lenox Avenue Mural\" by Zinn), covers the Civil Rights Movement. Zinn argues that the government began making reforms against discrimination (although without making fundamental changes) for the sake of changing its international image, but often did not enforce the laws that it passed. Zinn also argues that while nonviolent tactics may have been required for Southern civil rights activists, militant actions (such as those proposed by Malcolm X) were needed to solve the problems of black ghettos. Also covered is the involvement of the Communist Party in the movement, the Congress of Racial Equality, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the Freedom Riders, COINTELPRO, and the Black Panther Party.\\n Chapter 18, \"The Impossible Victory: Vietnam\", covers the Vietnam War and resistance to it. Zinn argues that America was fighting a war that it could not win, as the Vietnamese people were in favor of the government of Ho Chi Minh and opposed the regime of Ngo Dinh Diem, thus allowing them to keep morale'),\n",

Meanwhile, the American military\\'s morale was very low, as many soldiers were put off by the atrocities which were made to take part in, such as the My Lai massacre. Zinn also tries to dispel the popular belief that opposition to the war was mainly among college students and middle-class intellectuals, using statistics from the era to show higher opposition from the working class. Zinn argues that the troops themselves also opposed the war, citing desertions and refusals to go to war, as well as movements such as Vietnam Veterans Against the War. Also covered is the US invasions of Laos and Cambodia, Agent Orange, the Pentagon Papers, Ron Kovic, and raids on draft boards.\\n Chapter 19, \"Surprises\", covers other movements that happened during the 1960s, such as second-wave feminism, the prison reform/prison abolition movement, the Native American rights movement, and the counterculture. People and events from the feminist movement covered include Betty Friedan\\'s The Feminine Mystique, Women\\'s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell, Patricia Robinson, the National Domestic Workers Union, National Organization for Women, Roe v. Wade, Susan Brownmiller\\'s Against Our Will, and Our Bodies, Ourselves. People and events from the prison movement covered include George Jackson, the Attica Prison riots, and Jerry Sousa. People and events from the Native American rights movement covered include the National Indian Youth Council, Sid Mills, Akwesasne Notes, Indians of All Tribes, the First Convocation of American Indian Scholars, Frank James, the American Indian Movement, and the Wounded Knee incident. People and events from the counterculture covered include Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Malvina Reynolds, Jessica Mitford\\'s The American Way of Death, Jonathan Kozol, George Dennison, and Ivan Illich.\\n Chapter 20, \"The Seventies: Under Control?\", covers political corruption and American disillusion with the government during the 1970s. Zinn argues that the resignation of President Richard Nixon and the exposure of crimes committed by the CIA and FBI during the decade were done by the government in order to regain support from the American people without making fundamental changes to the system.  According to Zinn, Gerald Ford\\'s presidency continued the same basic policies of the Nixon administration.

W. Bush administrations and their effects on both the American people and foreign countries. Zinn argues that the Democratic and Republican parties keep the government essentially the same, maintaining policies favorable for corporations and militant foreign policy whichever party was in power. Zinn uses similarities among the three administrations\\' methods to argue for this. Other topics covered include the Fairness Doctrine, the Indonesian invasion of East Timor, Noam Chomsky, global warming, Roy Benavidez, the Trident submarine, the Star Wars program, the Sandinista National Liberation Front, the Iran–Contra affair, the War Powers Act, U.S. invasion of Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War, the Invasion of Grenada, Óscar Romero, the El Mozote massacre, the 1986 Bombing of Libya, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States invasion of Panama, and the Gulf War.\\n Chapter 22, \"The Unreported Resistance\", covers several movements that happened during the Carter-Reagan-Bush years that were ignored by much of the mainstream media. Topics covered include the anti-nuclear movement, the Plowshares Movement, the Council for a Nuclear Weapons Freeze, the Physicians for Social Responsibility, George Kistiakowsky, The Fate of the Earth, Marian Wright Edelman, the Citizens\\' Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes, the Three Mile Island accident, the Winooski 44, Abbie Hoffman, Amy Carter, the Piedmont Peace Project, Anne Braden, César Chávez, the United Farm Workers, the Farm Labor Organizing Committee, Teatro Campesino, LGBT social movements, the Stonewall riots, Food Not Bombs, the anti-war movement during the Gulf War, David Barsamian, opposition to Columbus Day, Indigenous Thought, Rethinking Schools, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\\n Chapter 23, \"The Coming Revolt of the Guards\", covers Zinn\\'s theory on a'),\n",

Zinn argues that there will eventually be a movement made up not only of groups previously involved in radical change (such as labor organizers, black radicals, Native Americans, feminists), but also members of the middle class who are starting to become discontented with the state of the nation. Zinn expects this movement to use \"demonstrations, marches, civil disobedience; strikes and boycotts and general strikes; direct action to redistribute wealth, to reconstruct institutions, to revamp relationships\".[24]\\n Chapter 24, \"The Clinton Presidency\", covers the effects of the Bill Clinton administration on the U.S. and the world. Zinn argues that despite Clinton\\'s claims that he would bring change, his presidency kept many things the same. Topics covered include Jocelyn Elders, the Waco siege, the Oklahoma City bombing, the Crime Bill of 1996, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, the 1993 bombing of Iraq, Operation Gothic Serpent, the Rwandan genocide, the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 1998 bombing of Afghanistan and Sudan, the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the impeachment of Bill Clinton, Barbara Ehrenreich\\'s Nickel and Dimed, Stand for Children, Jesse Jackson, the Million Man March, Mumia Abu-Jamal, John Sweeney, the Service Employees International Union, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, the Worker Rights Consortium, the Poor People\\'s Economic Human Rights Campaign, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Spare Change News, the North American Street Newspaper Association, the National Coalition for the Homeless, anti-globalization, and WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity.\\n Chapter 25, \"The 2000 Election and the \\'War On Terrorism\\'\", covers the 2000 presidential election and the War on Terrorism. Zinn argues that attacks on the U.S. by Arab terrorists (such as the September 11, 2001 attacks) are not caused by a hatred for our freedom (as claimed by President George W. Bush), but by grievances with U.S. foreign policies such as \"stationing of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia ... sanctions against Iraq which ... had resulted in the deaths of hundreds'),\n",

There are vivid descriptions of events that are usually ignored, such as the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 and the brutal suppression of the Philippine independence movement at the turn of this century. Professor Zinn\\'s chapter on Vietnam—bringing to life once again the free-fire zones, secret bombings, massacres and cover-ups—should be required reading for a new generation of students now facing conscription. Nonetheless, A People\\'s History reflects a deeply pessimistic vision of the American experience ... Uprisings are either crushed, deflected or co-opted ... Why such movements so often fail to achieve their goals is never adequately explained ... The portrayal of these anonymous Americans, moreover, is strangely circumscribed. Blacks, Indians, women, and laborers appear either as rebels or as victims. Less dramatic but more typical lives—people struggling to survive with dignity in difficult circumstances—receive little attention. Nor does Professor Zinn stop to explore the ideologies that inspired the various uprisings he details. Foner continues by remarking that \"history from the bottom up, though necessary as a corrective, is as limited in its own way as history from the top down.\" What is necessary, Foner asserts, is \"an integrated account incorporating Thomas Jefferson and his slaves, Andrew Jackson and the Indians, Woodrow Wilson and the Wobblies, in a continuous historical process, in which each group\\'s experience is shaped in large measure by its relation to others.\"[26]\\n Writing in The New York Times, columnist Bob Herbert wrote:\\n Mr. Zinn was often taken to task for peeling back the rosy veneer of much of American history to reveal sordid realities that had remained hidden for too long.[27]  Herbert quotes from Zinn\\'s account of the presidency of Andrew Jackson as an example of what he means.[27]\\n Also writing'),\n",

A conventional historical account held no allure; he concentrated on what he saw as the genocidal depredations of Christopher Columbus, the blood lust of Theodore Roosevelt and the racial failings of Abraham Lincoln. He also shined an insistent light on the revolutionary struggles of impoverished farmers, feminists, laborers and resisters of slavery and war. Such stories are more often recounted in textbooks today; they were not at the time.[28] Writing in Dissent, Georgetown University history professor Michael Kazin argued that Zinn is too focused on class conflict, and wrongly attributes sinister motives to the American political elite. He characterized the book as an overly simplistic narrative of elite villains and oppressed people, with no attempt to understand historical actors in the context of the time in which they lived. Kazin wrote:\\n The ironic effect of such portraits of rulers is to rob \\'the people\\' of cultural richness and variety, characteristics that might gain the respect and not just the sympathy of contemporary readers. For Zinn, ordinary Americans seem to live only to fight the rich and haughty and, inevitably, to be fooled by them.[29] Kazin argued that A People\\'s History fails to explain why the American political-economic model continues to attract millions of minorities, women, workers, and immigrants, or why the socialist and radical political movements Zinn favors have failed to gain widespread support among the American public.\\n Sam Wineburg, a professor of history at Stanford University, criticizes Zinn\\'s use of leading questions, cherry-picking of sources and presentation of disputable claims as facts. Wineburg used as an example Zinn\\'s claim that African Americans had \"widespread indifference, even hostility\" to the American war effort in World War II, which was supported by three quotes. According to Wineburg, Zinn drew the quotes from a book by Lawrence S. Wittner, but omitted evidence from the same pages that African Americans were underrepresented among draft evaders and conscientious objectors. Wineburg argued that the reason for the book\\'s longtime appeal was that it \"speaks directly to our inner Holden Caulfield.\"[30]\\n Writing in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Christopher Phelps, associate professor of American studies in the School of American and Canadian Studies at the University of'),\n",

I stood against the wall for a Zinn talk at the University of Oregon around the time of the 1992 Columbus Quincentenary. Listening to Zinn, one would have thought historians still considered Samuel Eliot Morison\\'s 1955 book on Columbus to be definitive. The crowd lapped it up, but Zinn knew better. He missed a chance to explain how the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s have transformed the writing and teaching of history, how his People\\'s History did not spring out of thin air but was an effort to synthesize a widely shared shift in historical sensibilities. Zinn\\'s historical theorizing, conflating objectivity with neutrality and position with bias, was no better.\\nThe critics would be churlish, however, not to acknowledge the moving example Zinn set in the civil-rights and Vietnam movements, and they would be remiss not to note the value of A People\\'s History, along with its limitations. Zinn told tales well, stories that, while familiar to historians, often remained unknown to wider publics. He challenged national pieties and encouraged critical reflection about received wisdom. He understood that America\\'s various radicalisms, far from being \"un-American,\" have propelled the nation toward more humane and democratic arrangements. And he sold two-million copies of a work of history in a culture that is increasingly unwilling to read and, consequently, unable to imagine its past very well.[31] In The New York Times Book Review in a review of A Young People\\'s History Of The United States, volumes 1 and 2, novelist Walter Kirn wrote:\\n That America is not a better place—that it finds itself almost globally despised, mired in war, self-doubt and random violence—is also a fact, of course, but not one that Zinn\\'s brand of history seems equal to. His stick-figure pageant of capitalist cupidity can account, in its fashion, for terrorism—as when, in the second volume, subtitled \"Class Struggle to the War on Terror,\" he notes that Sept. 11 was an assault on \"symbols of American wealth and power\"—but it doesn\\'t address the themes of religious zealotry, technological change and cultural confusion that animate what I was taught in high school to label \"'),\n",

As for the \"new possibilities\" it points to, I can\\'t see them clearly.[7] Professors Michael Kazin, Michael Kammen and Mary Grabar condemn the book as a black-and-white story of elite villains and oppressed victims, a story that robs American history of its depth and intricacy and leaves nothing but an empty text simplified to the level of propaganda.[29][32][33]\\n \\n Other editions and related works \\n [edit] A version of the book titled The Twentieth Century contains only chapters 12–25 (\"The Empire and the People\" to \"The 2000 Election and the \\'War on Terrorism\\'\"). Although it was originally meant to be an expansion of the original book, recent editions of A People\\'s History now contain all of the later chapters from it.\\n In 2004, Zinn and Anthony Arnove published a collection of more than 200 primary source documents titled Voices of a People\\'s History of the United States, available both as a book and as a CD of dramatic readings. Writer Aaron Sarver notes that although Kazin \"savaged\" Zinn\\'s A People\\'s History of the United States, \"one of the few concessions Kazin made was his approval of Zinn punctuating \\'his narrative with hundreds of quotes from slaves and Populists, anonymous wage-earners and ... articulate radicals\\'\".[34]\\n Sarver argued that, whether Zinn intended it or not, Voices served as a useful response to Kazin\\'s critique. \"Voices is a vast anthology that tells heartbreaking and uplifting stories of American history. Kazin will be hard-pressed to charge Zinn with politicizing the intelligence here; the volume offers only Zinn\\'s sparse introductions to each piece, letting the actors and their words speak for themselves.\"[34]\\n In 2008, Zinn worked with Mike Konopacki and Paul Buhle on creating A People\\'s History of American Empire, a graphic novel that covers various historic subjects drawn from A People\\'s History of the United States as well as Zinn\\'s own history of his involvement in activism and historic events as covered in his autobiography You Can\\'t Be Neutral on'),\n",

Wealth is the total value of net possessions of an individual or household, while income is the total inflow of monetary assets over a given time period. Hence the change in wealth over that time period is equal to the income minus the expenditures in that period. Income is a so-called \"flow\" variable, while wealth is a so-called \"stock\" variable.\\n \\n Income as a metric \\n [edit]  [6] [7]  U.S. wealth inequality Affluence in the United States has been attributed in many cases to inherited wealth amounting to \"a substantial head start\":[8][9] in September 2012, the Institute for Policy Studies found that over 60 percent of the Forbes richest 400 Americans had grown up in the top 5% of households.[10]\\n Income is commonly used to measure affluence, although this is a relative indicator: a middle class person with a personal income of $77,500 annually and a billionaire may both be referred to as affluent, depending on reference groups. An average American with a median income of $32,000[11] ($39,000 for those employed full-time between the ages of 25 and 64)[12] when used as a reference group would justify the personal income in the tenth'),\n",

For example, in 2005 the median household income for a two income earner households was $67,000 while the median income for an individual employed full-time with a graduate degree was in excess of $60,000, demonstrating that nearly half of individuals with a graduate degree have earnings comparable with most dual income households.[12]\\n Overall, the term affluent may be applied to a variety of individuals, households, or other entities, depending on context. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau serves as the main guideline for defining affluence. U.S. government data not only reveal the nation\\'s income distribution but also the demographic characteristics of those to whom the term \"affluent\", may be applied.[15]\\n \\n Wealth \\n ['),\n",

Assuming that this household would have a $250,000 mortgage, $40,000 in car loans, and $10,000 in credit card debt, its debts would total $300,000. Subtracting the debts from the worth of this household\\'s assets (900,000 − $300,000 = $600,000), this household would have a net worth of $600,000. Net worth can vary with fluctuations in value of the underlying assets.\\n As one would expect, households with greater income often have the highest net worths, though high income cannot be taken as an always accurate indicator of net worth. Overall the number of wealthier households is on the rise, with baby boomers hitting the highs of their careers.[20] In addition, wealth is unevenly distributed, with the wealthiest 25% of US households owning 87%[22] of the wealth in the United States, which was $54.2\\xa0trillion in 2009.[23][24]\\n U.S. household and non-profit organization net worth rose from $44.2\\xa0trillion in Q1 2000 to a pre-recession peak of $67.7\\xa0trillion in Q3 2007. It then fell $13.1\\xa0trillion to $54.6\\xa0trillion in Q1 2009 due to the subprime mortgage crisis. It then recovered, rising consistently to $86.8\\xa0trillion by Q4 2015. This is nearly double the 2000 level.[25]\\n \\n Mechanisms to gain wealth \\n [edit] Assets are known as the raw materials of wealth. They include stocks, bonds, private companies, and real estate including homeownership.[26] While tangible assets are unequally distributed, financial assets are much more unequal. \\n These discrepancies exist because the many wealth building tools established by the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Affluence_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=' assets are much more unequal. \\n These discrepancies exist because the many wealth building tools established by the Federal Government work better for high earners. These include 401k plans, 403b plans, and IRAs. Traditional IRAs, 401k and 403b plans are tax shelters created for working individuals. These plans allow for tax sheltered (or pre-tax) contributions of earned income directly to tax sheltered savings accounts. Annual contributions are capped to ensure that high earners cannot enjoy the tax benefit disproportionately. The Roth IRA is another tool that can help create wealth in the working and middle classes.\\n Assets in Roth IRAs grow tax free; interests, dividends, and capital gains are all exempt from income taxes. Contributions to Roth IRAs are limited to those with annual incomes less than the threshold established yearly by the IRS, though this can easily and legally be circumvented by those with incomes past the threshold. The benefits of these plans, however, are only available to workers and families whose incomes and expenses allow them excess funds to commit for a long period, typically until the investor reaches age 59½. The effect of these tools are further limited by the contribution limits placed on them.\\n Including human capital such as skills, the United Nations International Human Dimensions Programme estimated the total wealth of the United States in 2008 to be $118\\xa0trillion.[27][28]\\n \\n Top percentiles of income \\n [edit] Affluence and economic standing within society are often expressed in terms of percentile ranking. The economic ranking is conducted either in terms of giving lower thresholds for a designated group (e.g. the top 5%, 10%, 15%, etc.) or in terms of the percentage of households/individuals with incomes above a certain threshold (e.g. above $75,000, $100,000, $200,000, etc.). \\n \\n Household income over time \\n [edit] Income in the United States Household income changes over time, with income gains being substantially larger for the upper percentiles than for the lower percentiles.[29] All areas of the income strata have seen their incomes rise since the late 1960s, especially during the late 1990s.[30] \\n Two income-earner households are more common among the top quintile of households than the general population: 2006 U.S. Census Bureau data indicates that over three quarters, 76%, of households in the top quintile, with annual incomes exceeding $91,200, had two or more income earners compared to just 42% among the'),\n",

As a result, much of the rising income inequity between the upper and lower percentiles can be explained through the increasing percentage of households with two or more incomes.[19][29]\\n Source: U.S. Census Bureau (2004): \"Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2003\", p.\\xa036 et seq. All figures are inflation-adjusted and given in 2003 dollars.[30]\\n \\n Income distribution over time \\n [edit] Income inequality in the United States  [31]  [31] logarithmic scale  [32] According to the Congressional Budget Office, between 1979 and 2007 incomes of the top 1% of Americans grew by an average of 275%. During the same time period, the 60% of Americans in the middle of the income scale saw their income rise by 40%. From 1992 to 2007 the top 400 income earners in the U.S. saw their income increase 392% and their average tax rate reduced by 37%.[33] In 2009, the average income of the top 1% was $960,000 with a minimum income of $343,927.[34][35][36]\\n During the economic expansion between 2002 and 2007, the income of the top 1% grew 10 times faster than the income of the bottom 90%.  In this period 66% of total income gains went to the 1%, who in 2007 had a larger share of total income than at any time since 1928.[35] According to PolitiFact and others, the top 400 wealthiest Americans \"have more wealth than half of all Americans combined.\"[37][38][39][40] Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a \"substantial head start\".[8][9] In September 2012, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, \"over 60 percent\" of the Forbes richest 400 Americans \"grew up in substantial privilege\".[10]\\n If a family has a positive net worth then it has more wealth than the combined net worth of over 30.6\\xa0million American families. This is because the bottom 25% of American families have a negative combined net worth.[41]\\n \\n Complications in interpreting income statistics \\n [edit] Many people[42][43][44][who?] look only at annual reported income data split into income quintiles'),\n",

It is erroneous to assume that individual households remain in the same quintile over time, just as it usually is when using aggregate data. A majority of households in the top income quintile in one year, for example, will have moved to a lower quintile within a decade. Three out of four households in the top 0.01% of income will no longer be in that small group ten years later. In summary, half of all of U.S. households move from one income quintile to a different income quintile every decade. And actual households who started a decade in the lowest quintile of income, when tracked over the next ten years, will have proportionally more income growth than actual households who started the decade in the highest quintile of income. Thus, when comparing income/wealth quintile distributions from different time periods, generalizations can only be made with regards to the households in aggregate for each quintile, and can not be made to any individual households over the same time period (i.e. assuming the wealth value has been appropriately adjusted for differences in time, one cannot infer that a decrease in total wealth percentage for one quintile over time means that the households from that quintile have lost wealth as individuals, but only that total wealth percentage has decreased for those in that quintile at the time of measurement).\\n Top 20% income vs. the bottom 20% income households:\\n The average number of people with jobs in a top income quintile household is two, while a majority of bottom-income-quintile households have no-one employed. If there are two adult income earners in a household who are married, their incomes are combined on tax forms. This is very common among top-quintile-income households. The lowest-quintile households, however, include a lot more single-person households, or two unmarried working adults living together and sharing expenses, but reporting their incomes to the IRS as if they were two separate households. 75%...80%[clarification needed] of actual income for bottom-quintile-households consists of specific transfer payments from social or relief programs (aka \"welfare\" and other benefits), which payments are not included in IRS data as income. The top income quintile gets a very small percentage of their actual income from transfer payments. The IRS warns against comparisons of pre-1987 and post-1987 income data due to significant'),\n",

The IRS warns against comparisons of pre-1987 and post-1987 income data due to significant changes in the definition of adjusted gross income (AGI) that made top-quintile households appear to have large reported income gains, when in fact there was no change to their income at all. In addition to AGI changes, large marginal tax rate reductions during the Reagan Administration caused another large change in tax reporting. A lot of corporate income formerly reported on corporate tax returns was switched to lower-tax-rate individual tax returns (as Subchapter S corporations). This reporting change appeared to boost top-quintile income, when in fact their incomes had not changed. As a result, the top income quintile for households today includes a lot of corporate income previously reported in corporate tax returns, while Subchapter S corporations that lose money, are likely to be included in the bottom-income-quintile households. Income comparisons that compare pre-1987 to post-1987 income, are very common, but they are also biased, according to the IRS, and should be ignored.[45] Impact of age and experience:  people that are older and have more experience, tend to have considerably larger incomes than younger and inexperienced workers. Normalizing for age and experience is rarely an effective statistical compensation, as each elderly citizen began as inexperienced.\\n \\n Median income levels \\n [edit] Personal income in the United States Household income in the United States [46] educational attainment [47] [48] \\n Wealth distribution \\n [edit]  [49]  [49]  [50]  [51]  [52] According to an analysis that excludes pensions and social security, the richest 1% of the American population in 2007 owned 34.6% of the country\\'s total wealth, and the next 19% owned 50.5%.

The Great Recession also caused a drop of 36.1% in median household wealth but a drop of only 11.1% for the top 1%.[55][53]\\n \\n Income inequality \\n [edit] Income inequality in the United States Economists and related experts have described America\\'s growing income inequality as \"deeply worrying\",[56] unjust,[57] a danger to democracy/social stability,[58][59][60] and a sign of national decline.[61] Yale professor Robert Shiller, who was among three Americans who won the Nobel prize for economics in 2013, said after receiving the award, \"The most important problem that we are facing now today, I think, is rising inequality in the United States and elsewhere in the world.\"[62]\\n \\n Changes in wealth \\n [edit] \\n 1989–2001 \\n [edit] When observing the changes in the wealth among American households, one can note an increase in wealthier individuals and a decrease in the number of poor households, while net worth increased most substantially in semi-wealthy and wealthy households. Overall the percentage of households with a negative net worth (more debt than assets) declined from 9.5% in 1989 to 4.1% in 2001.[20]\\n The percentage of net worths ranging from $500,000 to one million doubled while the percentage of millionaires tripled.[20] From 1995 to 2004, there was tremendous growth among household wealth, as it nearly doubled from $21.9\\xa0trillion to $43.6\\xa0trillion, but the wealthiest quartile of the economic distribution made up 89% of this growth.[23] During this time frame, wealth became increasingly unequal, and the wealthiest 25% became even wealthier.\\n According to U.S. Census Bureau statistics, this \\'upward shift\\' is most likely the result of a booming housing market which caused homeowners to experience tremendous increases in home equity.

Life-cycles have also attributed to the rising wealth among Americans. With more and more baby-boomers reaching the climax of their careers and the middle-aged population making up a larger segment of the population now than ever before, more and more households have achieved comfortable levels of wealth.[20] Zhu Xiao Di (2004) notes, that household wealth usually peaks around families headed by people in their 50s, and as a result, the baby boomer generation reached this age range at the time of the analysis.[23]\\n \\n After 2007 \\n [edit] Household net worth fell from 2007 to 2009 by a total of $17.5\\xa0trillion or 25.5%. This was the equivalent loss of one year of GDP.[63]\\nBy the fourth quarter of 2010, the household net worth had recovered by a growth of 1.3 percent to a total of $56.8\\xa0trillion. An additional growth of 15.7 percent is needed just to bring the value to where it was before the recession started in December 2007.[22] In 2014 a record breaking net worth of $80.7\\xa0trillion was achieved.[64]\\n The income disparities even within the top 1.5% are quite drastic.[65] While households in the top 1.5% of households had incomes exceeding $250,000, 443% above the national median, their incomes were still 2200% lower than those of the top 0.1% of households.\\n \\n Occupations \\n [edit] High-net-worth individual Top-earning professions include medicine, dentistry, law, engineering, finance, and corporate executive management. A correlation has been shown between increases in income and increases in worker satisfaction. Increasing worker satisfaction, however, is not solely a result of the increase in income: workers in more complex and higher level occupations tend to have attained higher levels of education and thus are more likely to have a greater degree of autonomy in the workplace.[66] Additionally, higher level workers with advanced degrees are hired to share their personal knowledge, to conceptualize, and to consult. Higher-level workers typically suffer less job alienation and reap not only external benefits in terms of income from their jobs, but also enjoy high levels of intrinsic motivation and satisfaction.[14][66]\\n In the United States, the highest earning occupational group is referred to as white collar professionals.

Defining income based on title of a profession can be misleading, given that a professional title may indicate the type of education received, but does not always correlate with the actual day to day income-generating endeavors that are pursued.\\n Some sources cite the profession of physician in the United States as the highest paying,[14] Physician (MD and DO) and Dentist (DMD and DDS) compensation ranks as the highest median annual earnings of all professions. Median annual earnings ranged from $149,310 for general dentists and $156,010 for family physicians to $321,686 for anesthesiologists. Surgeons post a median annual income of $282,504.[67] However, the annual salary for Chief Executive Officer (C.E.O.) is projected quite differently based on source: Salary.com reports a median salary of $634,941,[68] while the U.S. Department of Labor in May 2004 reported the median as $140,350.[69] This is primarily due to a methodological difference in terms of which companies were surveyed. Overall annual earnings among the nation's top 25 professions ranged from the $70,000s to the $300,000s.\\n In addition to physicians, lawyers, physicists, and nuclear engineers were all among the nation's 20 highest paid occupations with incomes in excess of $78,410.[70] Some of the other occupations in the high five-figure range were economists with a median of $72,780,[71] mathematicians with $81,240,[72] financial managers with $81,880,[73] and software publishers with median annual earnings of $73,060.[74] The median annual earnings of wage-and-salary pharmacists in May 2006 were $94,520. The median annual earnings of wage-and-salary engineers in November 2011 were $90,000.

An individual's personal career decisions, as well as his or her personal connections within the nation's economic institutions, are also likely to have an effect on income, status and whether or not an individual may be referred to as affluent.[13]\\n In contemporary America it is a combination of all these factors, with scarcity remaining by far the most prominent one, which determine a person's economic compensation. Due to higher status professions requiring advanced and thus less commonly found skill sets (including the ability to supervise and work with a considerable autonomy), these professions are better compensated through the means of income, making high status individuals affluent, depending on reference group.[14]\\n While the two paragraphs above only describe the relationship between status and personal income, household income is also often used to infer status. As a result, the dual income phenomenon presents yet another problem in equating affluence with high societal status. As mentioned earlier in the article, 42% of households have two or more income earners, and 76% of households with six figure incomes have two or more income earners.[15] Furthermore, people are most likely to marry their professional and societal equals.\\n It therefore becomes apparent that the majority of households with incomes exceeding the six figure mark are the result of an economic as well as personal union between two economic equals. Today, two nurses, each making $55,000 a year, can easily out-earn a single attorney who makes the median of $95,000 annually.[70][94] Despite household income rising drastically through the union of two economic equals, neither individual has advanced his or her function and position within society. Yet the household (not the individual) may have become more affluent, assuming an increase in household members does not offset the dual-income derived gains.\\n \\n Wealth statistics \\n [edit] Family net worth \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tU.S. mean family net worth by percentile of net worth (1989–2007)\"),\n",

Not until later in the seventies (in urban gay centers) and well into the eighties (in smaller communities) did the marches begin to be called \"gay pride parades\".[5] The movement involved the lesbian and gay communities in North America, South America, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\\n Gay liberation is also known for its links to the counterculture of the time (e.g. groups like the Radical Faeries) and for the gay liberationists\\' intent to transform or abolish fundamental institutions of society such as gender and the nuclear family,[5] regardless of whether they had anything to do with the actual principles of gay rights.[9] In general, the politics were radical, anti-racist, and anti-capitalist.[10] In order to achieve such goals, consciousness raising and direct action were employed. While HIV/AIDS activism and awareness (in groups such as ACT UP) radicalized a new wave of lesbians and gay men in the 1980s, and radical groups have continued to exist ever since, by the early 1990s the radicalism of gay liberation was eclipsed in the mainstream by newly-out, pro-assimilationist gay men and women who stressed civil rights and mainstream politics.[11]\\n The term gay liberation sometimes refers to the broader movement to end social and legal oppression against LGBT people.[12][13] Sometimes the term gay liberation movement is even used synonymously or interchangeably with the gay rights movement.['),\n",

In the early 1890s, the trial of Oscar Wilde was widely reported in Germany and spurred discussion of homosexuality, leading to the homosexual emancipation movement in Germany, the first modern gay rights movement.[18][19]\\n The movements of the period immediately preceding gay liberation, from the end of World War II to the late 1960s, are known collectively as the homophile movement.[20] The homophile movement has been described as \"politically conservative\", although its calls for social acceptance of same-sex love were seen as radical fringe views by the dominant culture of the time.\\n \\n Name \\n [edit] While the movement always included all LGBT people, in those days the unifying term was \"gay\", and later, \"lesbian and gay\", much as in the late eighties and early nineties, \"queer\" was reclaimed as a one-word alternative to the ever-lengthening string of initials, especially when used by radical political groups.[11] Specifically, the word \\'gay\\' was preferred to previous designations, such as homosexual or homophile, that were still in use by mainstream news outlets, when they would carry news about gay people at all. The New York Times refused to use the word \\'gay\\' until 1987, up to that time insisting on \\'homosexual\\'.[21]\\n \\n 1960s \\n [edit] Early 1960s New York City, under the Wagner mayoral administration, was beset with harassment against the gay community, particularly by the'),\n",

Homosexuals were among the targets of a drive to rid the city of undesirables. Consequently, only the Mafia had the power and financial resources to run gay bars and clubs. By 1965, influenced by Frank Kameny\\'s addresses in the early 1960s, Dick Leitsch, the president of the New York Mattachine Society, advocated direct action, and the group staged the first public homosexual demonstrations and picket lines in the 1960s.[22] Kameny, founder of Mattachine Washington in 1961, had advocated militant action reminiscent of the black civil rights campaign, while also arguing for the morality of homosexuality.\\n The New York State Liquor Authority (SLA) did not allow homosexuals to be served in licensed bars in the state under penalty of revocation of the bar\\'s license to operate.  This denial of public accommodation had been confirmed by a court decision in the early 1940s. A legal study on the city\\'s alcoholic beverage law commissioned by Mattachine New York concluded there was no law per se prohibiting homosexuals gathering in bars; however, laws did prohibit disorderly conduct — which the SLA had been interpreting as homosexual behavior — in bars. Leitsch informed the press that three members of Mattachine New York would turn up at a restaurant on the Lower East Side, announce their homosexuality and, upon the refusal of service, make a complaint to the SLA. This came to be known as the \"Sip-In\" and only succeeded at the third attempt[clarification needed] at Julius in Greenwich Village. The \"Sip-In\", though, did gain extensive media attention and the resultant legal action against the SLA eventually prevented the agency from revoking licenses on the basis of homosexual solicitation in 1967.\\n At the beginning of gay rights protest, news on Cuban prison work camps for homosexuals inspired the Mattachine Society to organize protests at the United Nations and the White House, in 1965.[23][24]\\n In the years before 1969, the organization also was effective in getting New York City to change its policy of police entrapment of gay men, and to rescind its hiring practices designed to screen out gay people.[25] However, the significance of the new John Lindsay administration and the use of the media by Mattachine New York should not be underestimated in ending police entrapment.

By late 1967, a New York group called the Homophile Youth Movement in Neighborhoods (HYMN), essentially a one-man operation on the part of Craig Rodwell, was already espousing the slogans \"Gay Power\" and \"Gay is Good\" in its publication HYMNAL.\\n The 1960s was a time of social upheaval in the West, and the sexual revolution and counterculture influenced changes in the homosexual subculture, which in the U.S. included bookshops, publicly sold newspapers and magazines, and a community center. It was during this time that Los Angeles saw its first big gay movement. In 1967, the night of New Years, several plainclothes police officers infiltrated the Black Cat Tavern.[26] After arresting several patrons for kissing to celebrate the occasion,[27] the officers began beating several patrons[28] and ultimately arrested 16 more bar attendees including three bartenders.[28] This created a riot in the immediate area, ultimately bringing about a more civil demonstration of over 200 attendees several days later protesting the raids.[29] The protest was met by squadrons of armed policemen.[26] It was from this event that the publication The Advocate and organization Metropolitan Community Church (led by Pastor Troy Perry) were born.[30]\\n Few areas in the U.S. saw a more diverse mix of subcultures than Greenwich Village, which was host to the gay street youth. A group of young, effeminate runaways, shunned by their families, society, and the gay community, they reflected the countercultural movement more than any other homosexual group. Refusing to hide their homosexuality, they were brutalized, rebellious tearaways who took drugs, fought, shoplifted and hustled older gay men in order to survive. Their age, behavior, feminine attire and conduct left them isolated from the rest of the gay scene, but living close to the streets, they made the perfect warriors for the imminent Stonewall Riots. These emerging social possibilities, combined with the new social movements such as Black Power, women\\'s liberation, and the student insurrection of May 1968 in France, heralded a new era of radicalism. After the Stonewall riots in New York City in late June 1969, many within the emerging gay liberation movement in the U.S. saw themselves as connected with the New Left rather than the established hom'),\n",

The words \"gay liberation\" echoed \"women\\'s liberation\"; the Gay Liberation Front consciously took its name from the National Liberation Fronts of Vietnam and Algeria; and the slogan \"Gay Power\", as a defiant answer to the rights-oriented homophile movement, was inspired by Black Power, which was a response to the civil rights movement.[31]\\n \\n Vanguard 1965–1967 \\n [edit] Vanguard (organization) Vanguard was a gay rights youth organization active from 1965 into 1967 in San Francisco. It was founded by Adrian Ravarour and Billy Garrison, and Vanguard magazine was founded by Jean-Paul Marat and Keith St.Clare. Ravarour had been asked by Joel Williams to help the Tenderloin LGBT youth who suffered discrimination.[32] Seeing their conditions, Ravarour, a priest, led Vanguard for ten months and taught gay rights, then led Vanguard members in early demonstrations for equal rights. After he resigned in May 1966, J. P. Marat joined Vanguard and led it in six months of protests. Glide Church began to sponsor it in June 1966 assisting Vanguard to apply to become a non-profit and apply for the EOC grant. The organization dissolved due to internal clashes in late 1966 and early 1967. Former members reorganized as The Gay and Lesbian Center and Glide re-directed the EOC funds intended for Vanguard to form a service agency and new non-profit The Hospitality House.[33]\\n \\n 1969 \\n [edit] On March 28, 1969, in San Francisco, Leo Laurence (the editor of Vector, magazine of the United States\\' largest homophile organization, the Society for Individual Rights) called for \"the Homosexual Revolution of 1969\", exhorting gay men and lesbians to join the Black Panthers and other left-wing groups and to \"come out\" en masse. Laurence was expelled from the organization in May for characterizing members as \"timid\" and \"middle-class, uptight, bitchy old queens\".\\n Laurence then co-founded a militant group the Committee for Homosexual Freedom with Gale Whittington, Mother Boats, Morris Kight and others. Whittington had been fired from States Steamship Company for being openly gay, after a photo of him by Mother Boats appeared in the Berkley Barb, next to the headline \"HOMOS, DON\\'T HIDE'),\n",

The same month Carl Wittman, a member of CHF began writing Refugees from Amerika: A Gay Manifesto, which would later be described as \"the bible of Gay Liberation\". It was first published in the San Francisco Free Press and distributed nationwide, all the way to New York City, as was the Berkeley Barb with Laurence\\'s stories on CHF\\'s gay guerrilla militant initiatives and Mother Boats\\' photographs.\\n CHF was soon renamed the Gay Liberation Front (GLF); the Gay Liberation Front was a loose network of organizations throughout the US and abroad that determined their own political goals and modes of organization.[34] One GLF statement of purpose explained their revolutionary ambitions:[35]\\n We are a revolutionary group of men and women formed with the realization that complete sexual liberation for all people cannot come about unless existing social institutions are abolished. We reject society\\'s attempt to impose sexual roles and definitions of our nature. Gay Liberation Front activist Martha Shelley wrote, \"We are women and men who, from the time of our earliest memories, have been in revolt against the sex-role structure and nuclear family structure.\"[36]\\n In December 1969 the Gay Liberation Front made a cash donation to the Black Panthers, some of whose leaders had expressed homophobic sentiments.[citation needed] Prominent GLF members were also strong supporters of Fidel Castro\\'s regime. These actions cost GLF, a numerically small group, popular support in New York City, and some of its members left to form the Gay Activists\\' Alliance.[25]  The GLF virtually disappeared from the New York City political scene after the first Stonewall commemoration parade in 1970.[citation needed]\\n Mark Segal, a member of GLF from 1969 to 1971, continued[when?] to push gay rights in various venues. As a pioneer of the local gay press movement, he was one of the founders and former president of both the National Gay Press Association and the National Gay Newspaper Guild.[citation needed] He also is the founder and publisher of the award-winning Philadelphia Gay News which recently[when?] celebrated its 30th anniversary.[citation needed] In 1973 Segal disrupted the CBS evening news with Walter Cronkite, an event covered in newspapers across the country and viewed by 60% of American households, many seeing or hearing about homosexuality for the first time.[citation needed] Before the networks agreed to'),\n",

The trade newspaper Variety claimed that Segal had cost the industry $750,000 in production, tape delays, and lost advertising revenue.  Aside from publishing, Segal has also reported on gay life from far reaching places as Lebanon, Cuba, and East Berlin during the fall of the Berlin Wall. He and Bob Ross, former publisher of San Francisco\\'s Bay Area Reporter represented the gay press and lectured in Moscow and St. Petersburg at Russia\\'s first openly gay conference, referred to as Russia\\'s Stonewall.[citation needed] He recently coordinated a network of local gay publications nationally to celebrate October as gay history month,[citation needed] with a combined print run reaching over a half million people.[citation needed] His determination to gain acceptance and respect for the gay press can be summed up by his 15-year battle to gain membership in the Pennsylvania Newspaper Association one of the nation\\'s oldest and most respected organizations for daily and weekly newspapers. The battle ended after The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia Daily News and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette joined forces and called for PGN\\'s membership. In 2005, he produced Philadelphia\\'s official July 4 concert for a crowd estimated at 500,000 people. The show featured Sir Elton John, Patti LaBelle, Bryan Adams, and Rufus Wainwright. On a recent anniversary of PGN, an editorial in The Philadelphia Inquirer stated: \"Segal and PGN continue to step up admirably to the challenge set for newspapers by H.L. Mencken: to afflict the comfortable and to comfort the afflicted.\"[citation needed]\\n \\n 1970s \\n [edit]  Gay Liberation Front street theatre  anticapitalist Frente de Liberación Homosexual Buenos Aires By the summer of 1970, groups in at least eight American cities were sufficiently organized to schedule simultaneous events commemorating the Stonewall riots for the last Sunday in June. The events varied from a highly political march of three to five thousand in New York and thousands more at parades in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.

Groups with a \"Gay Lib\" approach began to spring up around the world, such as Campaign Against Moral Persecution (CAMP, Inc.), and Gay Liberation Front groups in Australia, Canada, the US and the UK. The lesbian group Lavender Menace was also formed in the U.S. in response to both the male domination of other Gay Liberation groups and the anti-lesbian sentiment in the Women\\'s Movement. Lesbianism was advocated as a feminist choice for women, and the first currents of lesbian separatism began to emerge.[citation needed]\\n In August of the same year, Huey Newton, the leader of the Black Panthers, publicly expressed his support for gay liberation in his letter titled \"A Letter from Huey to the Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters About the Women\\'s Liberation and Gay Liberation Movements\" [37] stating that:[37]\\n Whatever your personal opinions and your insecurities about homosexuality and the various liberation movements among homosexuals and women (and I speak of the homosexuals and women as oppressed groups), we should try to unite with them in a revolutionary fashion.\\n ...\\n \\nSome people say that [homosexuality] is the decadence of capitalism. I don\\'t know if that is the case; I rather doubt it. But whatever the case is, we know that homosexuality is a fact that exists, and we must understand it in its purest form: that is, a person should have the freedom to use his body in whatever way he wants. This statement by Newton was revolutionary. There has been another black civil rights organization that saw gay and lesbians as another oppressed group in the United States during this decade.[38] Newton recognized the same challenges that both oppressed groups face. He writes in his letter:\\n We haven\\'t said much about the homo-\\n sexual at all but we must relate to the homosexual movement because it\\'s a real thing. I know through reading, and through my life experience, my observations, that homosexuals are not given freedom and liberty by anyone in the society. Maybe they might be the most oppressed people in the society.[38]  Furthermore, Newton called for the removal of derogatory terms in the Black Panther\\'s vocabulary.[38] This helped advance the Gay Liberation Movement and legitimized it even further.\\n Although a short-lived group, the Comite Pederastique de la Sorbonne, had meetings during the student uprising of May 1968, the real public debut'),\n",

Kleinberg, Herman Kleinstein, a Catholic priest, and a dwarf, were suddenly interrupted by a group of lesbians from the audience, yelling, \"It\\'s not true, we\\'re not suffering! Down with the heterocops!\" The protesters stormed the stage, one young woman taking hold of the priest\\'s head and pounding it repeatedly against the table. The control room quickly cut off the microphones and switched to recorded music.[39] Later on the 15th of May the first specifically Gay Power march takes place in Europe in Örebro, Sweden, led by a group known as Gay Power Club\\xa0[sv].[40]\\n In 1971, Dennis Altman published Homosexual: Oppression and Liberation, considered an important intellectual contribution to the ideas that shaped gay liberation movements in the English-speaking world. Among his ideas were \"the polymorphous whole\"[41]:\\u200a58–95\\u200a and his posing of the notion of \"the end of the homosexual\",[41]:\\u200a216–228\\u200a in which the potential for both heterosexual and homosexual behaviour becomes a widespread cultural and psychological phenomenon.[42]:\\u200a116\\u200a Similarly, Allen Young\\'s 1972 manifesto \"Out of the Closet, into the Streets\" envisions gay liberation as the recognition of humanity\\'s innate bisexuality and androgyny within relationships that are free, expressive, and equal. Young portrays lesbians and gay men as the vanguard of sexual and human liberation.[42]:\\u200a118\\u200a Sociologist Steven Seidman interprets these intellectual productions as precursors to queer theory.[42]\\n \\n See also \\n [edit] Decriminalization of homosexuality Gay Lib v.

It was hosted as well as won by the United States and took place from June 19 to July 10, 1999, at eight venues across the country. The tournament was the most successful FIFA Women\\'s World Cup in terms of attendance, television ratings, and public interest.\\n The 1999 edition was the first to field sixteen teams, an increase from the twelve in 1995, and featured an all-female roster of referees and match officials. It was played primarily in large American football venues due to expected demand following the successful 1996 Olympics women\\'s tournament. The average attendance was 37,319 spectators per match and the total attendance was 1.194 million, a record that stood until 2015. The tournament earned a profit of $4 million on its $30 million operating budget.\\n The final, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, was attended by 90,185 people, setting an international record for spectators at a women\\'s sporting event. The United States won the tournament by defeating China in a penalty shootout after a scoreless draw. The 5–4 shootout ended with Brandi Chastain scoring the winning penalty with her team\\'s fifth kick, following an earlier miss by China\\'s Liu Ying. Chinese forward Sun Wen and Brazilian midfielder Sissi were the joint top goalscorers of the tournament, with seven goals each.\\n The tournament was considered a \"watershed moment\" for women\\'s soccer in the U.S. that increased interest and participation in women\\'s soccer. A new professional league, the Women\\'s United Soccer Association, was established following the tournament, and played three seasons before folding because of financial difficulties.

International women\\'s soccer had gained popularity in the 1970s, following the easing of gender sanctions by national associations, and competitions were organized between national teams, including the Mundialito and Women\\'s World Invitational Tournament.[1] A FIFA-organized women\\'s tournament was hosted by China in 1988 and was followed by the announcement of the first FIFA Women\\'s World Cup, to be hosted by China'),\n",

At FIFA's request, the tournament's organizers had originally planned to use five smaller college football venues on the East Coast located in a single time zone. The final match would be staged at RFK Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C.[10][15] Following the success of the inaugural women's soccer tournament at the 1996 Summer Olympics, which had high attendances and culminated in 76,489 watching the gold medal match,[16] the organizing committee chose to use larger stadiums instead and received 15 bids in 1997.[4][17][18]\\n The eight venues and host cities were announced on November 19, 1997, including five large American football venues that were used in the 1994 men's World Cup.[14] The tournament final was awarded to the Rose Bowl\"),\n",

The opening match would be played at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, near New York City.[11] The tournament's organizing committee estimated that the 1999 World Cup would average an attendance of 25,000 per match, with U.S. matches and later knockout ties at near sellouts in the larger venues.[14] Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in Landover, Maryland, serving the Washington, D.C. market, had a limited capacity of 41,000 seats because of ongoing construction during the group stage. It was later raised to 55,000 for the quarterfinals.[19]\\n Two smaller venues, Civic Stadium in Portland, Oregon, and Spartan Stadium in San Jose, California, were chosen to each host several group stage matches and one quarterfinal doubleheader.[11] For the tournament, Civic Stadium was outfitted with a temporary grass field that was laid over its artificial turf surface, which debuted during a warm-up friendly on June 6.[20] Other venues underwent small modifications to host the tournament's matches, including converting American football locker rooms to accommodate more teams and changing the dimensions of the playing field.[13]\\n Ticket pre-sales at discounted prices began in October 1997 and over 300,000 were sold by April 1999.[21] By early June, ticket sales had reached 500,000—setting a new record for a women's sporting event by surpassing the NCAA women's basketball tournament.[22] The opening weekend's eight matches were organized into four doubleheaders that attracted a total of 134,236 spectators, surpassing the total attendance for the 1995 World Cup; the United States–Denmark match drew a crowd of 78,972 at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, setting a new U.S. record for attendance at a women's sporting event.[23] That figure was later surpassed by the final, played between the United States and China at the Rose Bowl in front of a crowd of 90,185 spectators—a world record for women's sports.[24]\\n \\n Participating teams and officials \\n [edit] \\n Qualification \\n [edit] 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification  The 1999 Women's World Cup had sixteen participating teams, an increase from the twelve in 1995 and the largest field in the tournament's history.[26] Ghana, Mexico,\"),\n",

The remaining participants were determined through a series of six tournaments run by the continental confederations of world soccer from 1997 to 1998; these comprised 63 countries playing in 141 matches.[26] FIFA allocated six berths to Europe; three to Asia; two to Africa; and one each to North America (excluding the hosts), Oceania, and South America.[30] Another berth (for Mexico) was determined by a play-off series between the second-place finishers in the North and South American tournaments.[26]\\n \\n Draw \\n [edit] The tournament\\'s final draw took place on February 14, 1999, on a temporary outdoor stage at Spartan Stadium in San Jose, California.[31] It was televised live by ESPN during the halftime of an exhibition match between the United States women\\'s team and the FIFA Women\\'s World Stars at the stadium.[32] The United States lost the match 2–1, their first home defeat in more than 40 matches.[33]\\n The draw was conducted using four pots of four teams each. The four highest-ranked teams, China, Germany, Norway, and the United States, were seeded into Pot A. The remaining pots were organized based on geographic location, with four European teams in Pot B, South America, Asia, and Oceania represented in Pot C, and North America and Africa in Pot D. The United States was placed in slot A1, separated from Canada and Mexico; similarly, China was separated from Japan and North Korea in the draw.[34]\\n As a result of the restrictions in seeding and pot placement, two of the World Cup groups each contained two European teams.[34] Group B was dubbed the \"group of death\" because it contained non-seeded Brazil, an Olympic semi-finalist, alongside Germany, Italy, and Mexico.[35][36] The teams drawn in Groups C and D were switched to place China\\'s opening'),\n",

The sixteen participating national associations were required to confirm their final rosters no later than June 9, 1999.[37] Three days after the deadline, the full rosters were published by FIFA on their website.[38] Several teams, including the United States, Canada, and Mexico, drew much of their roster from U.S. college teams.[27][39][40] The oldest player at the tournament was Norwegian captain Linda Medalen, who turned 34 before the opening matchday, while the youngest was 16-year-old Ifeanyi Chiejine of Nigeria.[41]\\n \\n Match officials \\n [edit] The 1999 tournament was the first World Cup to feature a pool of 31 referees composed entirely of women—the result of a directive from FIFA president Sepp Blatter approved the year before.[42] They worked in groups during matching and training and were divided between two base facilities in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. to reduce travel.[43] Before the tournament, several coaches raised concerns over the quality of the referee pool, particularly those chosen for geographic diversity.[44] By the end of the group stage, several coaches had complained of inconsistent fouls and offside calls. This was blamed in part on the referees being inexperienced with working in front of large crowds.[45] In a post-tournament report, FIFA stated that the trial of all-female referees had been successful and that further development would produce better results in future tournaments.[46]\\n FIFA published the final list of referees on April 13, 1999.[47] From this list, only Ghanaian assistant referee Juliana Akuteye did not officiate at the tournament. American referee Kari Seitz was selected in June as a replacement for another official who had been denied a travel visa to the United States.[48][49]\\n \\n Preparations \\n [edit] The organizing committee for the 1999 tournament was led by chairwoman Donna de Varona, a former Olympian swimmer and co-founder of the Women's Sports Foundation,[50][51] and president Marla Messing, an attorney and\"),\n",

Headquartered in Century City, California,[52] it had a $30 million budget for the tournament, a tenth of that for the men's tournament.[53] It was partially funded by a $2.5 million loan from the U.S. Soccer Foundation using profits from the 1994 men's World Cup.[21][54] Messing submitted the committee's business plan for the tournament in September 1998, two days before giving birth.[55]\\n The event attracted funding from several major corporate sponsors who had previously shied away from women's soccer, including: McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Fujifilm, Gillette, and Allstate; the companies, however, did not promote the tournament through advertising and tie-in campaigns like they did for the 1994 men's World Cup.[7] The tournament's official equipment sponsor was Adidas, who supplied the match balls and other equipment.[56] A new Women's World Cup Trophy was commissioned for the tournament, designed by William Sawaya of Sawaya & Moroni.[57] It cost $30,000 to design and assemble the 4.6-kilogram (10\\xa0lb) trophy. Following a bureaucratic issue that prevented it from being displayed at the February draw, it was unveiled on April 19, 1999.[58][59] FIFA also organized several other business events during the tournament, including the FIFA Women's Football Symposium and an extraordinary session of the FIFA Congress. Both took place in Los Angeles before the final.[60]\\n Following the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade a few weeks before the tournament, organizers feared the Chinese team would pull out of the World Cup. However, the team played as planned and reached the final, and the presidents of the United States and China exchanged congratulatory messages.[61][62] The closing of the U.S. embassy in Beijing also affected the visa process for the North Korean team and staff, as the country did not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., but their visas were approved in time for the tournament.[63]\\n \\n Media and marketing \\n [edit] All 32 matches were televised in the United States on ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2, of which 26 were live broadcasts and six were tape delayed.[64][65] The\"),\n",

It also cross-promoted the tournament during its television broadcasts.[21][67] Over 2,000 accredited journalists covered the event, including 950 writers, 410 photographers, and 600 broadcast personnel.[68] Several major newspapers in the United States sent reporters to cover matches, with credentialed staff growing in number as the tournament went on, while others declined to produce content beyond wire reports.[69]\\n The official slogan of the tournament was \"This is my game. This is my future. Watch me play.\" It was unveiled alongside the logo and branding in July 1997.[51][70] Tickets were marketed primarily to young girls and their fathers, rather than the stereotypical \"soccer mom\", and sold out quickly.[71] The organizing committee sponsored and arranged training camps and other events for youth soccer players in host cities. Some of these included appearances by members of the United States team to advertise the tournament and invite players and their families to attend matches.[21][72] Boy band \\'N Sync and pop performers B*Witched and Billie performed at the opening ceremony for the Women\\'s World Cup at Giants Stadium;[73] Billie\\'s single \"Because We Want To\" was chosen as the tournament\\'s official song.[74] Jennifer Lopez performed at the closing ceremony before the final, where she also recorded an official music video for her single \"Let\\'s Get Loud\".[75][76]\\n \\n Group stage \\n [edit] The sixteen participating teams were organized into four groups, labeled A to D, by the final draw on February 14, 1999.[31] The group stage consisted of 24 matches played in a round-robin format, in which each team played one match against the other three in their group.[77] Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw, and none for a defeat.[78] The winners and runners-up from each group qualified for the first round of the knockout stage, which began with the quarter-finals on June 30, 1999.[77'),\n",

For the first time in Women's World Cup history, the golden goal would be used during extra time to instantly decide the winner in sudden death.[113] If the score remained tied at the end of extra time, a penalty shootout would ensue.[114][115]\\n \\n Bracket \\n [edit] \\n Quarterfinals \\n [edit] The first match of a quarterfinals doubleheader at Spartan Stadium in San Jose featured China and Russia, the only team to debut at the tournament and also advance to the knockout stage.[116] China advanced with a 2–0 victory over Russia, with goals by Pu Wei and Jin Yan, while their opponents did not manage a shot towards goal until stoppage time.[117] The second match of the doubleheader, between neighboring rivals Norway and Sweden, began with a scoreless first half and ended with four goals scored in the second half for a 3–1 Norwegian win. Norway opened the scoring with a header by Ann Kristin Aarønes in the 51st minute, which was followed by a goal from Marianne Pettersen in the 58th minute and a penalty scored by Hege Riise in the 72nd minute; Sweden scored a consolation goal by way of a run and shot from Malin Moström in the 90th minute.[118][119]\\n The next doubleheader, at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium near Washington, D.C., began with a match between the United States and Germany played in front of 54,642, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton, and Chelsea Clinton.[120] U.S. defender Brandi Chastain scored an own goal in the fifth minute after\"),\n",

Chastain redeemed herself by scoring the second equalizing goal for the U.S. in the 49th minute, finishing a corner kick that was taken by Mia Hamm.[122] Defender Joy Fawcett's header off a corner kick in the 66th minute proved to be the game-winning goal, allowing the United States to advance with a 3–2 defeat of the Germans.[121]\\n The second match at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, featuring Brazil and Nigeria, was the first in FIFA Women's World Cup history to be decided by a golden goal in extra time.[123] Cidinha scored twice in the first 22 minutes of the match and was joined by Nenê in the 35th minute to give Brazil a 3–0 lead at half-time. Nigeria substituted goalkeeper Ann Chiejine for Judith Chime and began pressing its attackers early in the second half. The Super Falcons scored their first goal in the 63rd minute, Prisca Emeafu taking advantage of a defensive mistake, and added a second through Nkiru Okosieme's shot off a rebound in the 72nd minute. Nkechi Egbe scored the equalizing goal for Nigeria in the 85th minute with a far-post strike from 14 yards (13\\xa0m). The goal forced sudden death extra time, which Nigeria would play with only 10 players after forward Patience Avre was ejected in the 87th minute for receiving a second yellow card.[124] Brazilian midfielder Sissi, who had assisted two of the first-half goals, scored the golden goal from 22 yards (20\\xa0m) in the 104th minute to win the match 4–3 for Brazil.[123][125]\\n The top seven quarterfinalists also qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics alongside hosts Australia, who were eliminated in the group stage.[29] The Olympics qualification was determined by a series of tiebreakers, beginning with the margin of defeat in the quarterfinal match, followed by goals scored in the quarterfinal and group stage performance.[126] Although Russia and Sweden both lost by two goals, the Swedes had scored in\"),\n",

Both teams played regular season matches afterwards against the MetroStars and D.C. United, respectively.[129][130] The United States faced Brazil at Stanford Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area in front of 73,123 spectators. The U.S. began the match with an early lead, following a mistimed catch from Brazilian goalkeeper Maravilha that allowed Cindy Parlow to score from a header in the fifth minute. Brazil responded with several shots in the second half that required goalkeeper Briana Scurry to make three major saves to preserve the lead.[131] On a counterattack in the 80th minute, U.S. striker Mia Hamm drew a penalty kick on a foul from Brazilian captain Elane. Veteran midfielder Michelle Akers, who had stayed on despite two serious head collisions, converted the penalty kick to give the United States a 2–0 victory.[132]\\n In the second semifinal, played before 28,986 attendees at Foxboro Stadium in Massachusetts, China defeated reigning champions Norway in a 5–0 rout that matched the team's worst-ever margin of defeat.[133] Sun Wen opened the scoring in the third minute, with a rebounded shot off a save by goalkeeper Bente Nordby. This was followed by a right-footed volley by Liu Ailing eleven minutes later off a corner kick, increasing the team's lead to 2–0.

Pretinha had two chances to score for Brazil and take the lead, but they were denied by Norwegian goalkeeper Bente Nordby late in the second half.[136] After remaining scoreless through regulation time and stoppage time, the match advanced straight into a penalty shootout; the standard golden goal extra time was skipped due to the constraints of television scheduling ahead of the final.[115] Pretinha missed the opening penalty for Brazil, but the remaining five taken by her teammates were all converted; Norway lost its lead in the shootout with a miss in the third round by Silje Jørgensen, and the shootout ended 5–4 in Brazil's favor after the sixth round following a miss by Ann Kristin Aarønes and a successful shot by Formiga.[115][135]\\n \\xa0(1999-07-10) PDT UTC−7 Rose Bowl, Pasadena Im Eun-ju South Korea \\n Final \\n [edit] 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup final  Brandi Chastain The 1999 final at the Rose Bowl was played in front of 90,185 spectators, claimed to be a world record for a women's sports event,[137] while its U.S. television broadcast averaged 17.9 million viewers and peaked at 40 million.[35][138] The two finalists, the United States and China, had previously met in the gold medal match at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, which the U.S. won 2–1.[137] With several unsuccessful attempts at the goal made by the hosts, the\"),\n",

China shot twice towards the U.S. goal in extra time, but saves by midfielder Kristine Lilly and goalkeeper Briana Scurry preserved the tie until the end of extra time.[139]\\n In the ensuing penalty shootout, the first four players scored on their shots before Liu Ying had her attempt in the third round saved by Scurry. Scurry was accused of cheating by multiple media outlets because she had intentionally stepped ahead of the goal line before saving Liu\\'s shot, but stated that \"everybody does it\".[140] Lilly and Mia Hamm successfully converted their penalties and gave the Americans a lead, but Zhang Ouying and Sun Wen were able to convert theirs and keep it tied 4–4.[141] Brandi Chastain, who had missed a penalty kick in the Algarve Cup against the Chinese months earlier, beat goalkeeper Gao Hong and won the shootout 5–4 for the United States.[139][142] Chastain celebrated by removing her jersey and revealing her sports bra underneath, creating one of the most iconic moments in women\\'s sports history as it appeared on the covers of major magazines and newspapers.[143][144][145]\\n \\xa0(1999-07-10) PDT UTC−7 Rose Bowl, Pasadena Nicole Petignat Switzerland \\n Aftermath and legacy \\n [edit] The 1999 Women\\'s World Cup is regarded as a watershed moment in the history of U.S. women\\'s soccer because of its cultural impact and the great public interest it generated.[146][147] It had a total attendance of 1.194 million spectators and averaged 37,319 per match. This remained the highest total attendance for any Women\\'s World Cup until 2015, which had more matches.[5] The tournament\\'s merchandise sales and television ratings were especially high in the U.S., including several matches that set record for ESPN and ESPN2.[148][149][150] The final held the record for the largest domestic television audience for a soccer match until the 2014 men\\'s World Cup.[151] The organizing committee reported an estimated profit of $4 million on its $30 million operating budget, making the tournament a financial success.[152]\\n The United States became the first team to win two Women\\'s World Cups as well as the first to simultaneously hold the World Cup and Olympic titles.[141] The team, nicknamed the \"99ers\" and regarded'),\n",

They appeared in national advertising campaigns for several major companies.[158] Although the team finished as silver medalists at the 2000 Summer Olympics behind Norway, the U.S. team would go on to win gold medals at the three subsequent Olympics.[159] The United States finished third at the next two editions of the Women\\'s World Cup and as runners-up to Japan in 2011 before winning their third World Cup title in 2015 and fourth in 2019.[160][161] Several members of the 2011, 2015, and 2019 teams cited the 1999 tournament as providing inspiration during their pursuit of a professional career in the sport.[162][163] Christie Rampone was the last member of the 1999 team to retire, doing so in 2017 after earning 311 caps.[164]\\n The organizers and supporters of the Women\\'s World Cup had hoped to ride the momentum from the tournament\\'s popularity to form a professional women\\'s soccer league akin to Major League Soccer, which was established after the 1994 men\\'s World Cup.[165][166] The Women\\'s United Soccer Association (WUSA) was formed in January 2000 and began play in April 2001 with eight teams and the support of the United States Soccer Federation.[167][168] The league\\'s $40 million, five-year budget lasted only one season while its attendance and television ratings struggled to meet projections and investor demands.[169] The league played three full seasons before folding in September 2003 with losses estimated at $90 million and an average attendance of 6,667 in its final season.[170] The league\\'s teams continued playing in exhibition matches, but eventually folded, while another professional league was founded in 2007 and folded after three seasons.[171][172] The National Women\\'s Soccer League was established in 2012 and is the longest-running women\\'s soccer league in U.S. history, drawing on greater financial and planning support from the United States Soccer Federation.[173][174]\\n China was originally awarded the rights to host the 2003 tournament, but the SARS outbreak forced them to withdraw as hosts.[175] The United States stepped in to host the tournament'),\n",

The host United States and China played to a scoreless draw following double golden goal extra time. After that, the United States won the title 5–4 with a penalties victory.[1][2]\\n The match represented one of the most important events in the history of American sports.[3] It was played before over 90,000 fans.[4] The well-known image of Brandi Chastain celebrating the winning spot kick that was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated became one of the defining images of women's sports in the United States.[5]\\n \\n Finalists \\n [edit] The match featured two powerhouses of women's association football. The United States had won the first Women's World Cup in China and the gold medal at the 1996 Olympics. China had won the silver at the 1996 Olympics and had defeated the United States in the final of the 1999 Algarve Cup. The teams featured two of the superstars of women's soccer, strikers Mia Hamm of the United States and Sun Wen of China.[6][7]\\n The United States was bidding to become the first team to win a world championship on home soil, something China had failed to do in 1991, as well as the first team to win multiple championships. China, meanwhile, was attempting to join the United States and Norway as World Cup champions.[6][7]\\n China were the first Asian national team to reach the FIFA Women's World Cup Final.[6] This was also the first Women's World Cup final not involving a European team.[citation needed]\\n \\n Route to the final \\n [edit] The United States had qualified automatically as host nation.[8] Accordingly, they elected to skip the 1998 CONCACAF Women's Championship, which served as the CONCACAF qualifier. They would not fail to win a CONCACAF championship again until 2010. China had qualified by winning their sixth straight AFC Women's Championship in 1997.[citation needed]\\n Once at the finals, the United States reached the knockout stage by easily winning Group A. After trailing 2–1 at halftime, they advanced through the quarterfinals by defeating Germany 3–2. The United States then defeated Brazil 2–0 to reach the final.[9]\\n China reached the knockout stage by winning Group D. They shut out Russia in the quarterfinals, then easily defeated\"),\n",

The United States and China played to a scoreless draw during regulation and golden goal extra time. The United States won the title 5–4 on a penalty shootout. The win gave the United States its second world cup title.[1]\\n The game was a tepid affair with neither side getting many chances. Perhaps the best chance for either team to score came in extra time, when China's Fan Yunjie hit a header toward the post that was defended by Kristine Lilly.[11]\\n After both teams failed to score, the teams squared off for a shootout to decide the winners of the cup. China shot first, and Xie Huilin scored, only to be matched by the United States' Carla Overbeck. In the second round, Qiu Haiyan's goal was matched by Joy Fawcett.\\n Liu Ying was China's third-round shooter, but her shot was saved by United States goalkeeper Briana Scurry. Despite Scurry coming well off her line (a violation that should have resulted in a re-kick for Liu), the save stood. Kristine Lilly then got a shot past Chinese goalkeeper Gao Hong to give the United States the advantage.\\n Zhang Ouying, Mia Hamm, and Sun Wen each converted their penalty opportunities, leaving the United States' Brandi Chastain with a shot to win the tournament. She put the ball past Gao, leading to an ecstatic celebration by the Americans, who had clinched the title on home soil.[12][13][14]\\n \\n Details \\n [edit] \\xa0(1999-07-10) PDT Rose Bowl, Pasadena Nicole Petignat Switzerland \\n Post-match \\n [edit] The United States became the first team to win two Women's World Cup titles.[16] Brandi Chastain's celebration, which ended with her removing her jersey and revealing her sports bra underneath, appeared on the covers of Sports Illustrated, Time, and various newspapers the following day.[17][18] The celebration was criticized for being disrespectful, unfeminine, or inappropriate, but has endured as one of the most iconic moments in women's sports history.[19] Chinese media protested\"),\n",

McPherson. It is the sixth volume of the Oxford History of the United States series. An abridged, illustrated version was published in 2003.[1] The book won the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for History.[2]\\n \\n Content \\n [edit] Battle Cry of Freedom is a narrative history[3] of two decades of the history of the United States from the outbreak of the Mexican–American War to the Civil War\\'s ending at Appomattox. Thus, it examined the Civil War era, not just the war, as it combined the social, military and political events of the period within a single narrative framework. Historian Hugh Brogan, reviewing the book, commends McPherson for initially describing \"the republic at midcentury\" as \"a divided society, certainly, and a violent one, but not one in which so appalling a phenomenon as civil war is likely. So it must have seemed to most Americans at the time. Slowly, slowly the remote possibility became horrible actuality; and Mr. McPherson sees to it that it steals up on his readers in the same way.\"[4]\\n A central concern of this work is the multiple interpretations of freedom. In an interview, McPherson claimed: \"Both sides in the Civil War professed to be fighting for the same \\'freedoms\\' established by the American Revolution and the Constitution their forefathers fought for in the Revolution—individual freedom, democracy, a republican form of government, majority rule, free elections, etc. For Southerners, the Revolution was a war of secession from the tyranny of the British Empire, just as their war was a war of secession from Yankee tyranny. For Northerners, their fight was to sustain the government established by the Constitution with its guaranties of rights and liberties.\"[5]\\n \\n Reception \\n [edit] Battle Cry of Freedom was an immediate commercial and critical success, spending 16 weeks on The New York Times hardcover bestseller list with an additional 12 weeks on the paperback list.[5] Historian Mark E. Neely Jr. praised the book\\'s wide-ranging coverage, writing that in the book McPherson \"seems equally interested in all aspects of the Civil War\" including but not limited to diplomacy, inflation, legislation, medicine, military campaigns, and prisoner-of-war exchanges.['),\n",

Cornish cited the lack of naval history as the book\\'s \"only discernable flaw\" and further commented by saying \"the book\\'s strongest connecting themes are the comprehensive discussions of diplomatic, economic, industrial, political, and social aspects of the nation\\'s travail.\"[7] Michael P. Johnson regarded the book as an overarching synthesis of evidence that refutes Walt Whitman\\'s claim that the war should primarily be understood from the perspective of the sufferers of battle. Johnson asserts that the book classifies the Civil War as revolving primarily around the politics of slavery, and he states that its title \"invites the conceptual miscalculation: Victory = Freedom\", this characterization being Johnson\\'s main critique. Still, he praises it for being \"as a narrative of wartime maneuvers-both political and military-[...] unsurpassed\".[8]\\n Robert Franklin Durden noted McPherson as \"in the nationalist tradition of [James Ford] Rhodes and [Allan] Nevins\" and his borrowed view of southerners as \"preemptive counterrevolutionaries\" from Arno Mayer.[9] Harold Hyman positively compared its compactness to Peter Parish\\'s America\\'s Civil War (1975), but criticized its misleading phraseology regarding geographic mobility of wage earners, his use of \"women of questionable virtue\", \"troop train\" when referring to events in 1861, the exclusive riding prowess of \"the sons of Virginia gentry\", and including the greying of Robert E. Lee\\'s beard instead of expanding on important issues such as slave marriage. However, he concluded readers \"will nevertheless reap large rewards from its pages.\"[10] Writing for The New York Times, Brogan described it as \"...the best one-volume treatment of its subject I have ever come across. It may actually be the best ever published.\"[4]\\n \\n Editions \\n [edit] McPherson, James M. (2003) [1988]. Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era. Oxford University Press.

In many regions a real estate bubble, it was the impetus for the subprime mortgage crisis. Housing prices peaked in early 2006, started to decline in 2006 and 2007, and reached new lows in 2011.[3] On December 30, 2008, the Case–Shiller home price index reported the largest price drop in its history.[4] The credit crisis resulting from the bursting of the housing bubble is an important cause of the Great Recession in the United States.[5]\\n Increased foreclosure rates in 2006–2007 among U.S. homeowners led to a crisis in August 2008 for the subprime, Alt-A, collateralized debt obligation (CDO), mortgage, credit, hedge fund, and foreign bank markets.[6] In October 2007, Henry Paulson, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, called the bursting housing bubble \"the most significant risk to our economy\".[7]\\n A bubble had the potential to affect not only on home valuations, but also mortgage markets, home builders, real estate, home supply retail outlets, Wall Street hedge funds held by large institutional investors, and foreign banks, increasing the risk of a nationwide recession.[8][9][10][11] Concerns about the impact of the collapsing housing and credit markets on the larger U.S. economy caused President George W. Bush and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke to announce a limited bailout of the U.S. housing market for homeowners who were unable to pay their mortgage debts.[12]\\n In 2008 alone, the United States government allocated over $900 billion (~$1.25\\xa0trillion in 2023) to special loans and rescues related to the U.S. housing bubble.  This was shared between the public sector and the private sector.  Because of the large market share of Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) (both of which are government-sponsored enterprises) as well as the Federal Housing Administration, they received a substantial share of government support, even though their mortgages were more conservatively underwritten and actually performed better than those of the private sector.[13]\\n \\n Background \\n [edit] Land prices contributed much more to the price increases'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_2000s_United_States_housing_bubble.txt'}, page_content='13]\\n \\n Background \\n [edit] Land prices contributed much more to the price increases than did structures.  This can be seen in the building cost index in Fig. 1.  An estimate of land value for a house can be derived by subtracting the replacement value of the structure, adjusted for depreciation, from the home price. Using this methodology, Davis and Palumbo calculated land values for 46 U.S. metro areas, which can be found at the website for the Lincoln Institute for Land Policy.[14]\\n Housing bubbles may occur in local or global real estate markets. In their late stages, they are typically characterized by rapid increases in the valuations of real property until unsustainable levels are reached relative to incomes, price-to-rent ratios, and other economic indicators of affordability. This may be followed by decreases in home prices that result in many owners finding themselves in a position of negative equity—a mortgage debt higher than the value of the property. The underlying causes of the housing bubble are complex. Factors include tax policy (exemption of housing from capital gains), historically low interest rates, lax lending standards, failure of regulators to intervene, and speculative fever.[6][8][15][16][17][18] This bubble may be related to the stock market or dot-com bubble of the 1990s.[1][19][20][21][22]  This bubble roughly coincides with the real-estate bubbles of the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Spain,[23] Poland, Hungary and South Korea.[24][25]\\n While bubbles may be identifiable in progress, bubbles can be definitively measured only in hindsight after a market correction,[26] which began in 2005–2006 for the U.S. housing market.[27][28][29][30][31][32] Former U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said \"We had a bubble in housing\",[33][34] and also said in the wake of the subprime mortgage and credit crisis in 2007, \"I really didn\\'t get it until very late in 2005 and 2006.\".[35]\\n The mortgage and credit crisis was caused by the inability of a large number of home owners to pay their mortgages as their low introductory-rate mortgages reverted to regular interest rates. Freddie Mac CEO Richard Syron concluded, \"We had a bubble\",[36] and concurred with Yale economist Robert Shiller\\'s warning that home prices appear overvalued and that the correction could last years, with trillions of dollars of home value being lost.['),\n",

Peter Schiff also called the bubble early on and was vocal about it on television and wrote a book detailing his predictions of the fallout.[46]\\n The burst of the housing bubble was predicted by a handful of political and economic analysts, such as Jeffery Robert Hunn in a March 3, 2003, editorial. Hunn wrote:\\n [W]e can profit from the collapse of the credit bubble and the subsequent stock market divestment [(decline)]. However, real estate has not yet joined in a decline of prices fed by selling (and foreclosing). Unless you have a'),\n",

Unless you have a very specific reason to believe that real estate will outperform all other investments for several years, you may deem this prime time to liquidate investment property (for use in more lucrative markets).[47] An August 2008 article in The New York Times reported that in mid-2004 Richard F. Syron, the CEO of Freddie Mac, received a memo from David Andrukonis, the company\\'s former chief risk officer, warning him that Freddie Mac was financing risk-laden loans that threatened Freddie Mac\\'s financial stability. In his memo, Mr. Andrukonis wrote that these loans \"would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country\".[48] The article revealed that more than two-dozen high-ranking executives said that Mr. Syron had simply decided to ignore the warnings.\\n Other cautions came as early as 2001, when the late Federal Reserve governor Edward Gramlich warned of the risks posed by subprime mortgages.[49] In September 2003, at a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, Congressman Ron Paul identified the housing bubble and foretold the difficulties it would cause: \"Like all artificially-created bubbles, the boom in housing prices cannot last forever. When housing prices fall, homeowners will experience difficulty as their equity is wiped out. Furthermore, the holders of the mortgage debt will also have a loss.\"[50] Reuters reported in October 2007 that a Merrill Lynch analyst too had warned in 2006 that companies could suffer from their subprime investments.\\n The Economist magazine stated, \"The worldwide rise in house prices is the biggest bubble in history\",[51] so any explanation needs to consider its global causes as well as those specific to the United States. The then Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said in mid-2005 that \"at a minimum, there\\'s a little \\'froth\\' (in the U.S. housing market) ... it\\'s hard not to see that there are a lot of local bubbles\"; Greenspan admitted in 2007 that froth \"was a euphemism for a bubble\".[34] In early 2006, President Bush said of the U.S. housing boom: \"If houses get too expensive, people will stop buying them ... Economies should cycle\".[52]\\n \\n Predictions of no bubble \\n [edit] Many contested any suggestion that there could be a housing bubble, particularly at its peak from 2004 to 2006,[53] with some rejecting the \"'),\n",

In many once-sizzling markets around the country, accounts of dropping list prices have replaced tales of waiting lists for unbuilt condos and bidding wars over humdrum three-bedroom colonials.\"[28]\\n Among other statements, the reports stated that people \"should [not] be concerned that home prices are rising faster than family income\", that \"there is virtually no risk of a national housing price bubble based on the fundamental demand for housing and predictable economic factors\", and that \"a general slowing in the rate of price growth can be expected, but in many areas inventory shortages will persist and home prices are likely to continue to rise above historic norms\".[citation needed] Following reports of rapid sales declines and price depreciation in August 2006,[61][62] Lereah admitted that he expected \"home prices to come down 5% nationally, more in some markets, less in others. And a few cities in Florida and California, where home prices soared to nose-bleed heights, could have \\'hard landings\\'.\"[31]\\n National home sales and prices both fell dramatically in March 2007 — the steepest plunge since the 1989 Savings and Loan crisis. According to NAR data, sales were down 13% to 482,000 from the peak of 554,000 in March 2006, and the national median price fell nearly'),\n",

Kilpatrick from Greenfield Advisors was cited by Bloomberg News on June 14, 2007, on the linkage between increased foreclosures and localized housing price declines: \"Living in an area with multiple foreclosures can result in a 10 percent to 20 percent decrease in property values\". He went on to say, \"In some cases that can wipe out the equity of homeowners or leave them owing more on their mortgage than the house is worth. The innocent houses that just happen to be sitting next to those properties are going to take a hit.\"[63]\\n The US Senate Banking Committee held hearings on the housing bubble and related loan practices in 2006, titled \"The Housing Bubble and its Implications for the Economy\" and \"Calculated Risk: Assessing Non-Traditional Mortgage Products\". Following the collapse of the subprime mortgage industry in March 2007, Senator Chris Dodd, Chairman of the Banking Committee held hearings and asked executives from the top five subprime mortgage companies to testify and explain their lending practices. Dodd said that \"predatory lending\" had endangered home ownership for millions of people.[18] In addition, Democratic senators such as Senator Charles Schumer of New York were already proposing a federal government bailout of subprime borrowers in order to save homeowners from losing their residences.[18]\\n \\n Causes \\n [edit] Causes of the United States housing bubble \\n Geographic Extent \\n [edit]  Economists have debated whether the early 2000s house price boom involved nationwide or local bubbles.\\n As early as 2005, because of non-uniform price appreciation, some economists, including former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, argued that United States was not experiencing a nationwide housing bubble per se, but a number of local bubbles.[64] In 2007, however, Greenspan stated that \"all the froth bubbles add up to an aggregate bubble\".[34]\\n Despite greatly relaxed lending standards and low interest rates, many regions of the country saw very little price appreciation during the \"bubble period\". Out of 20 largest metropolitan areas tracked by the S&P/Case-Shiller house price index, six (Dallas, Cleveland, Detroit, Denver, Atlanta, and Charlotte) saw less than 10% price growth in inflation-adjusted terms in 2001–2006.[65] During the same period, seven metropolitan areas (Tampa,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_2000s_United_States_housing_bubble.txt'}, page_content=\" terms in 2001–2006.[65] During the same period, seven metropolitan areas (Tampa, Miami, San Diego, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Washington, D.C.) appreciated by more than 80%.\\n However, housing bubbles did not manifest themselves in each of these areas at the same time. San Diego and Los Angeles had maintained consistently high appreciation rates since late 1990s, whereas the Las Vegas and Phoenix bubbles did not develop until 2003 and 2004 respectively. It was in the East Coast, the more populated part of the country where the economic real estate turmoil was the worst.\\n Somewhat paradoxically, as the housing bubble deflates[66] some metropolitan areas (such as Denver and Atlanta) have been experiencing high foreclosure rates, even though they did not see much house appreciation in the first place and therefore did not appear to be contributing to the national bubble. This was also true of some cities in the Rust Belt such as Detroit[67] and Cleveland,[68] where weak local economies had produced little house price appreciation early in the decade but still saw declining values and increased foreclosures in 2007. As of January 2009 California, Michigan, Ohio and Florida were the states with the highest foreclosure rates.\\n By July 2008, year-to-date prices had declined in 24 of 25 U.S. metropolitan areas, with California and the southwest experiencing the greatest price falls. According to the reports, only Milwaukee had seen an increase in house prices after July 2007.[69]\\n \\n Side effects \\n [edit] Prior to the real estate market correction of 2006–2007, the unprecedented increase in house prices starting in 1997 produced numerous wide-ranging effects in the economy of the United States.\\n  \\xa0 Single family home \\xa0 Multifamily residential \\xa0 2-4 unit residential One of the most direct effects was on the construction of new houses. In 2005, 1,283,000 new single-family houses were sold, compared with an average of 609,000 per year during 1990–1995.[70] The largest home builders, such as D. R. Horton, PulteGroup, and Lennar, improved operations significantly. D. R. Horton's stock went from $3 in early 1997 to all-time high of $42.82 on July 20, 2005. Pulte Corp's revenues grew from $2.33 billion in 1996 to $14.69 billion in 2005.[71][72][73] Mortgage equity withdrawals – primarily home equity loans and cash out refin\"),\n",

According to US Federal Reserve estimates, in 2005 homeowners extracted $750 billion of equity from their homes (up from $106 billion in 1996), spending two thirds of it on personal consumption, home improvements, and credit card debt.[74] It is widely believed that the increased degree of economic activity produced by the expanding housing bubble in 2001–2003 was partly responsible for averting a full-scale recession in the U.S. economy following the dot-com bust and offshoring to China. Analysts believed that with the downturn in the two sectors, the economy from the early 2000s to 2007 evaded what would have been stagnant growth with a booming housing market creating jobs, economic demand along with a consumer boom that came from home value withdraws until the housing market began a correction.[75] Rapidly growing house prices and increasing price gradients forced many residents to flee the expensive centers of many metropolitan areas, resulting in the explosive growth of exurbs in some regions. The population of Riverside County, California almost doubled from 1,170,413 in 1990 to 2,026,803 in 2006, due to its relative proximity to San Diego and Los Angeles. On the East Coast, Loudoun County, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., saw its population triple between 1990 and 2006.[76][citation needed] Extreme regional differences in land prices.  The differences in housing prices are mainly due to differences in land values, which reached 85% of the total value of houses in the highest priced markets at the peak.[14] The Wisconsin Business School publishes an on line database with building cost and land values for 46 U.S. metro areas.[14]  One of the fastest-growing regions in the United States for the last several decades was the Atlanta, Georgia metro area, where land values are a small fraction of those in the high-priced markets. High land values contribute to high living costs in general and are part of the reason for the decline of the old industrial centers while new automobile plants, for example, were built throughout the South, which grew in population faster than the other regions. People who either experienced foreclosures or live near foreclosures have a higher probability of falling ill or at the very least dealing with increased anxiety.  Overall, it is reported that homeowners who are unable to afford living in their desired locations experience higher instances of poor health. '),\n",

Besides health issues, the unstable housing market has also been shown to increase instances of violence.  They subsequently begin to fear that their own homes may be taken from them. Increases in anxiety have at the very least been commonly noted.  There is a fear that foreclosures bring about these reactions in people who anticipate the same thing happening to them.  An uptick on violent occurrences has also been shown to follow neighborhoods where such uncertainty exists. [citation needed] These trends were reversed during the real estate market correction of 2006–2007. As of August 2007, D.R. Horton\\'s and Pulte Corp\\'s shares had fallen to 1/3 of their respective peak levels as new residential home sales fell.  Some of the cities and regions that had experienced the fastest growth during 2000–2005 began to experience high foreclosure rates.[66] It was suggested that the weakness of the housing industry and the loss of the consumption that had been driven by the withdrawal of mortgage equity could lead to a recession, but as of mid-2007 the existence of this recession had not yet been ascertained.[77] In March 2008, Thomson Financial reported that the \"Chicago Federal Reserve Bank\\'s National Activity Index for February sent a signal that a recession [had] probably begun\".[78]\\n The share prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac plummeted in 2008 as investors worried that they lacked sufficient capital to cover the losses on their $5 (~$6.95\\xa0trillion in 2023) trillion portfolio of loans and loan guarantees.[79] On June 16, 2010, it was announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange; shares now trade on the over-the-counter market.[80]\\n \\n Housing market correction \\n [edit] United States housing market correction Basing their statements on historic U.S. housing valuation trends,[1][82] in 2005 and 2006 many economists and business writers predicted market corrections ranging from a few percentage points to 50% or more from peak values in some markets,[27][83][84][85][86][87] and although this cooling had not yet affected all areas of the U.S., some warned that it still could, and that the correction would be \"nasty\" and \"severe\".[88][89] Chief economist Mark Zandi of the economic research firm Moody\\'s Economy.com predicted a \"crash\" of double-digit depreciation'),\n",

The data seems to indicate that, while conditions are still difficult, in some ways the crisis is easing: Over the period studied, the percentage of families behind on mortgage payments fell from 2.2 to 1.9; homeowners who thought it was \"very likely or somewhat likely\" that they would fall behind on payments fell from 6% to 4.6% of families. On the other hand, family\\'s financial liquidity has decreased: \"As of 2009, 18.5% of families had no liquid assets, and by 2011 this had grown to 23.4% of families.\"[93][94]\\n By mid-2016, the national housing price index was \"about 1 percent shy of that 2006 bubble peak\" in nominal terms[95] but 20% below in inflation adjusted terms.[96]\\n \\n Subprime mortgage industry collapse \\n [edit] Subprime mortgage crisis  Bank run Northern Rock In March 2007, the United States\\' subprime mortgage industry collapsed due to higher-than-expected home foreclosure rates (no verifying source), with more than 25 subprime lenders declaring bankruptcy, announcing significant losses, or putting themselves up for sale.[97] The stock of the country\\'s largest subprime lender, New Century Financial, plunged 84% amid Justice Department investigations, before ultimately filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 2, 2007, with liabilities exceeding $100 million (~$142\\xa0million in 2023).[98]\\n The manager of the world\\'s largest bond fund, PIMCO, warned in June 2007 that the subprime mortgage crisis was not an isolated event and would eventually take a toll on the economy and ultimately have an impact in the form of impaired home prices.[99] Bill Gross, a \"most reputable financial guru\",[11] sarcastically and ominously'),\n",

You were wooed, Mr. Moody\\'s and Mr. Poor\\'s, by the makeup, those six-inch hooker heels, and a \"tramp stamp.\" Many of these good-looking girls are not high-class assets worth 100 cents on the dollar ... [T]he point is that there are hundreds of billions of dollars of this toxic waste ... This problem [ultimately] resides in America\\'s heartland, with millions and millions of overpriced homes.[11] Business Week has featured predictions by financial analysts that the subprime mortgage market meltdown would result in earnings reductions for large Wall Street investment banks trading in mortgage-backed securities, especially Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley.[97] The solvency of two troubled hedge funds managed by Bear Stearns was imperiled in June 2007 after Merrill Lynch sold off assets seized from the funds and three other banks closed out their positions with them. The Bear Stearns funds once had over $20 billion of assets, but lost billions of dollars on securities backed by subprime mortgages.[100]\\n H&R Block reported that it had made a quarterly loss of $677 million on discontinued operations, which included the subprime lender Option One, as well as writedowns, loss provisions for mortgage loans and the lower prices achievable for mortgages in the secondary market. The unit\\'s net asset value had fallen 21% to $1.1 billion as of April 30, 2007.[101] The head of the mortgage industry consulting firm Wakefield Co. warned, \"This is going to be a meltdown of unparalleled proportions. Billions will be lost.\" Bear Stearns pledged up to U.S. $3.2 billion (~$4.53\\xa0billion in 2023) in loans on June 22, 2007, to bail out one of its hedge funds that was collapsing because of bad bets on subprime mortgages.[102]\\n Peter Schiff, president of Euro Pacific Capital, argued that if the bonds in the Bear Stearns funds were auctioned on the open market, much weaker values would be plainly revealed. Schiff added, \"This would force other hedge funds to similarly mark down the value of their holdings. Is it any wonder that Wall street is pulling out the stops to avoid such a catastrophe? ... Their true weakness will'),\n",

Their true weakness will finally reveal the abyss into which the housing market is about to plummet.\"[103] The New York Times report connects the hedge fund crisis with lax lending standards: \"The crisis this week from the near collapse of two hedge funds managed by Bear Stearns stems directly from the slumping housing market and the fallout from loose lending practices that showered money on people with weak, or subprime, credit, leaving many of them struggling to stay in their homes.\"[102]\\n On August 9, 2007, BNP Paribas announced that it could not fairly value the underlying assets in three funds because of its exposure to U.S. subprime mortgage lending markets.[104]  Faced with potentially massive (though unquantifiable) exposure, the European Central Bank (ECB) immediately stepped in to ease market worries by opening lines of €96.8 billion (U.S. $130 billion) of low-interest credit.[105] One day after the financial panic about a credit crunch had swept through Europe, the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank conducted an \"open market operation\" to inject U.S. $38 billion in temporary reserves into the system to help overcome the ill effects of a spreading credit crunch, on top of a similar move the previous day.[citation needed]  In order to further ease the credit crunch in the U.S. credit market, at 8:15\\xa0a.m. on August 17, 2007, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank Ben Bernanke decided to lower the discount window rate, which is the lending rate between banks and the Federal Reserve Bank, by 50 basis points to 5.75% from 6.25%. The Federal Reserve Bank stated that the recent turmoil in the U.S. financial markets had raised the risk of an economic downturn.\\n In the wake of the mortgage industry meltdown, Senator Chris Dodd, chairman of the Banking Committee, held hearings in March 2007 in which he asked executives from the top five subprime mortgage companies to testify and explain their lending practices. Dodd said that \"predatory lending practices\" were endangering home ownership for millions of people.[18] In addition, Democratic senators such as Senator Charles Schumer of New York were already proposing a federal government bailout of subprime borrowers like the bailout made in the savings and loan crisis, in order to save homeowners from losing their residences. Opponents of such a proposal[who?] asserted that a government bailout of'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_2000s_United_States_housing_bubble.txt'}, page_content=' from losing their residences. Opponents of such a proposal[who?] asserted that a government bailout of subprime borrowers was not in the best interests of the U.S. economy because it would simply set a bad precedent, create a moral hazard, and worsen the speculation problem in the housing market.\\n Lou Ranieri of Salomon Brothers, creator of the mortgage-backed securities market in the 1970s, warned of the future impact of mortgage defaults: \"This is the leading edge of the storm ... If you think this is bad, imagine what it\\'s going to be like in the middle of the crisis.\" In his opinion, more than $100 billion of home loans were likely to default when the problems seen in the subprime industry also emerge in the prime mortgage markets.[106]\\n Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had praised the rise of the subprime mortgage industry and the tools which it uses to assess credit-worthiness in an April 2005 speech.[107] Because of these remarks, as well as his encouragement of the use of adjustable-rate mortgages, Greenspan has been criticized for his role in the rise of the housing bubble and the subsequent problems in the mortgage industry that triggered the economic crisis of 2008.[108][109] On October 15, 2008, Anthony Faiola, Ellen Nakashima and Jill Drew wrote a lengthy article in The Washington Post titled, \"What Went Wrong\".[110] In their investigation, the authors claim that Greenspan vehemently opposed any regulation of financial instruments known as derivatives. They further claim that Greenspan actively sought to undermine the office of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, specifically under the leadership of Brooksley E. Born, when the Commission sought to initiate the regulation of derivatives. Ultimately, it was the collapse of a specific kind of derivative, the mortgage-backed security, that triggered the economic crisis of 2008. Concerning the subprime mortgage mess, Greenspan later admitted that \"I really didn\\'t get it until very late in 2005 and 2006.\"[35]\\n On September 13, 2007, the British bank Northern Rock applied to the Bank of England for emergency funds because of liquidity problems related to the subprime crisis.[111] This precipitated a bank run at Northern Rock branches across the UK by concerned customers who took out \"an estimated £2bn withdrawn in just three days\".[112]\\n \\n See also \\n [edit] 2000s commodities boom 2010 United States foreclosure crisis Financial crisis of 2007–08 Great Recession Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems Synthetic CDO Real estate trend \\n'),\n",

Between 2010 and 2020, the US forests increased 0.03% annually, according to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations).[a]\\n Native Americans cleared millions of acres of forest for many reasons, including hunting, farming, berry production, and building materials.[1]  Prior to the arrival of European-Americans, about one half of the United States land area was forest, about 1,023,000,000 acres (4,140,000\\xa0km2) estimated in 1630. Forest cover in the Eastern United States reached its lowest point in roughly 1872 with about 48 percent compared to the amount of forest cover in 1620. The majority of deforestation took place prior to 1910 with the Forest Service reporting the minimum forestation as 721,000,000 acres (2,920,000\\xa0km2) around 1920.[2] The forest resources of the United States remained relatively constant through the 20th century.[3] The Forest Service reported total forestation as 766,000,000 acres (3,100,000\\xa0km2) in 2012.[4][5][3] A 2017 study estimated 3 percent loss of forest between 1992 and 2001.[6]\\n The 2005 (FAO) Global Forest Resources Assessment ranked the United States as seventh highest country losing  its old-growth forests, a vast majority of which were removed prior to the 20th century.[3]\\n \\n After European colonization \\n [edit] Forests of the United States For the 300 years following the arrival of Europeans, land was cleared, mostly for agriculture, at a rate that matched that of population growth.[7] During the 19th century, while the U.S. population tripled, the total area of cropland increased by over four times, from seventy-six million to three hundred nineteen million acres. For every person added to the U.S. population during this period, farmers put another three to four acres under the plow.[8] This trend continued until the 1920s when the amount of crop land stabilized in spite of continued population growth. As abandoned farm land reverted to forest the amount of forest land increased reaching a peak in 1963 of 753,000,000 acres (3,050,000\\xa0km2).[4]\\n After 1963, there was a gradual decrease through the next few decades which has been reversed with recovery and slight gains in the early 21st century.

Gains in forest land have resulted from conversions from crop land and pastures at a higher rate than loss of forest to development. However issues have been identified such as the continued loss of old-growth forest,[9] the increased fragmentation of forest lands, and the increased urbanization of forest land.[10] Between 2001 and 2020, Alaska lost more tree cover than any other U.S. state.[11]\\n \\n Previous issues \\n [edit]  Deforestation in the United States was affected by many factors. One such factor was the effect, whether positive or negative, that the logging industry has on forests in the country. Logging in the United States is a hotly debated topic as groups who either support or oppose logging argue over its benefits and negative effects.\\n The biggest issue thought to be facing deforestation in the United States was illegal logging. The Forest Service and EPA work together to make sure that the permits for logging companies in the United States are granted in such a way that the forests are kept healthy and sustainable, and illegal logging reduces the chances that forests will be kept this way.[citation needed]\\n It has also been argued that trees can lower temperatures by around 10 degrees Fahrenheit and their removal can lead to warmer temperatures.[12]\\n \\n Species extinctions in the Eastern forests \\n [edit] Of the 28 forest bird species with habitat exclusively in that forest, Pimm claims four become extinct either wholly or mostly because of habitat loss, the passenger pigeon, Carolina parakeet, ivory-billed woodpecker, and Bachman\\'s warbler.

It is one of the Four Corners states, sharing a border Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico.  It also borders Wyoming to its northeast, Idaho to its north, and Nevada to its west. In comparison to all the U.S. states and territories, Utah, with a population of just over three million, is the 13th largest by area, the 30th most populous, and the 11th least densely populated. Urban development is mostly concentrated in two regions: the Wasatch Front in the north-central part of the state, which includes the state capital, Salt Lake City, and is home to roughly two-thirds of the population; and Washington County in the southwest, which has somewhat more than 180,000 residents.[9] Most of the western half of Utah lies in the Great Basin.\\n Utah has been inhabited for thousands of years by various indigenous groups, such as the ancient Puebloans, the Navajo, and the Ute. The first Europeans to arrive -  in the mid-16th century - were the Spanish. Because of the region's challenging geography and harsh climate, it only became a peripheral part of New Spain (and later of Mexico). Even while it was Mexican territory, many of the Utah region’s earliest European settlers were from the United States; notable among these were Mormons who were fleeing marginalization and persecution in the United States and arrived via the so-called Mormon Trail.

In 1848, after the Mexican–American War, the region was annexed by the U.S., becoming part of the Utah Territory, which included what later became Colorado and Nevada. Disputes between the dominant Mormon community and the federal government delayed Utah's admission as a state: in 1896, after it agreed to outlaw polygamy, it was admitted as the 45th state.\\n People from Utah are known as Utahns.[10] Slightly over half of all Utahns are Mormons, the vast majority of whom are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which has its world headquarters in Salt Lake City;[11] Utah is the only state where a majority of the population belongs to a single church.[12] The LDS Church greatly influences Utahn culture, politics, and daily life,[13] though since the 1990s the state has become more religiously diverse as well as secular.\\n Utah has a highly diversified economy, with major sectors including transportation, education, information technology and research, government services, mining, multi-level marketing, and tourism.[14] Utah has been one of the fastest growing states since 2000,[15] with the 2020 U.S. census confirming the fastest population growth in the nation since 2010. St. George was the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States from 2000 to 2005.[16] Utah ranks among the overall best states in metrics such as healthcare, governance, education, and infrastructure.[17] It has the 12th-highest median average income and the least income inequality of any U.S. state. Over time and influenced by climate change, droughts in Utah have been increasing in frequency and severity,[18] putting a further strain on Utah's water security and impacting the state's economy.[19]\\n \\n Etymology \\n The name Utah derives from the name of the Ute tribe, meaning 'people of the mountains'.[20] However, no such word exists in the Utes' language, and the Utes refer to themselves as Noochee. The meaning of Utes as 'the mountain people' has been attributed to the neighboring Pueblo Indians,[21] as well as to the Apache word Yuttahih, which means 'one that is higher up' or 'those that are higher up'.[20] In Spanish, it was pronounced Yuta; subsequently, English-speaking people may have adapted the word\"),\n",

Ancestral Pueblo peoples built their homes through excavations in mountains, and the Fremont people built houses of straw before disappearing from the region around the 15th century.\\n Another group of Native Americans, the Navajo, settled in the region around the 18th century. In the mid-18th century, other Uto-Aztecan tribes, including the Goshute, the Paiute, the Shoshone, and the Ute people, also settled in the region. These five groups were present when the first European explorers arrived.[23][24]\\n \\n Spanish exploration (1540) \\n New Spain The Californias §\\xa0History First Mexican Empire Provisional Government of Mexico First Mexican Republic Centralist Republic of Mexico The southern Utah region was explored by the Spanish in 1540, led by Francisco Vázquez de Coronado while looking for the legendary Cíbola. A group led by two Catholic priests—sometimes called the Domínguez–Escalante expedition—left Santa Fe in 1776, hoping to find a route to the coast of California. The expedition traveled as far north as Utah Lake and encountered the native residents. The Spanish made further explorations in the region but were not interested in colonizing the area because of its desert nature. In 1821, the year Mexico achieved its independence from Spain, the region became known as part of its territory of Alta California.\\n European trappers and fur traders explored some areas of Utah in the early 19th century from Canada and the United States. The city of Provo, Utah, was named for one Étienne Provost, who visited the area in 1825. The city of Ogden, Utah, was named after Peter Skene Ogden, a Canadian explorer who traded furs in the Weber Valley.\\n In late 1824, Jim Bridger became the first known English-speaking person to sight the Great Salt Lake.

Over the next 22 years, more than 70,000 pioneers crossed the plains and settled in Utah.[27] For the first few years, Brigham Young and the thousands of early settlers of Salt Lake City struggled to survive. The arid desert land was deemed desirable by the Mormons as a place where they could practice their religion without harassment.\\n Settlers buried thirty-six Native Americans in one grave after an outbreak of measles occurred during the winter of 1847.[28]\\n The first group of settlers brought three African slaves with them, making Utah the only place in the western United States to have African slavery.[29] The three slaves, Green Flake, Hark Lay, and Oscar Crosby, came west with the first group of settlers in 1847.[30]\\n Utah was a Mexican territory when the first pioneers arrived in 1847. Early in the Mexican–American War in late 1846, the United States had taken control of New Mexico and California. The entire Southwest became U.S. territory upon the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, February 2, 1848. The treaty was ratified by the United States Senate on March 11.

Salt Lake City became the hub of a \"far-flung commonwealth\"[31] of Mormon settlements. With new church converts coming from the East and around the world, Church leaders often assigned groups of church members as missionaries to establish other settlements throughout the West. They developed irrigation to support fairly large pioneer populations along Utah\\'s Wasatch front (Salt Lake City, Bountiful and Weber Valley, and Provo and Utah Valley).[32] Throughout the remainder of the 19th century, Mormon pioneers established hundreds of other settlements in Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Wyoming, California, Canada, and Mexico—including in Las Vegas, Nevada; Franklin, Idaho (the first European settlement in Idaho); San Bernardino, California; Mesa, Arizona; Star Valley, Wyoming; and Carson Valley, Nevada.\\n Prominent settlements in Utah included St. George, Logan, and Manti (where settlers completed the LDS Church\\'s first three temples in Utah, each started after but finished many years before the larger and better-known temple built in Salt Lake City was completed in 1893), as well as Parowan, Cedar City, Bluff, Moab, Vernal, Fillmore (which served as the territorial capital between 1850 and 1856), Nephi, Levan, Spanish Fork, Springville, Provo Bench (now Orem), Pleasant Grove, American Fork, Lehi, Sandy, Murray, Jordan, Centerville, Farmington, Huntsville, Kaysville, Grantsville, Tooele, Roy, Brigham City, and many other smaller towns and settlements. Young had an expansionist view of the territory that he and the Mormon pioneers were settling, calling it Deseret—which according to the Book of Mormon was an ancient word for \"honeybee\".

Slavery was abolished in the territory during the Civil War.\\n In 1850, Salt Lake City sent out a force known as the Nauvoo Legion and engaged the Timpanogos in the Battle at Fort Utah.[36]:\\u200a71\\u200a\\n Disputes between the Mormon inhabitants and the U.S. government intensified due to the practice of plural marriage, or polygamy, among members of the LDS Church. The Mormons were still pushing for the establishment of a State of Deseret with the new borders of the Utah Territory. Most, if not all, of the members of the U.S. government opposed the polygamous practices of the Mormons.\\n Members of the LDS Church were viewed as un-American and rebellious when news of their polygamous practices spread. In 1857, particularly heinous accusations of abdication of government and general immorality were leveled by former associate justice William W. Drummond, among others. The detailed reports of life in Utah caused the administration of James Buchanan to send a secret military \"expedition\" to Utah. When the supposed rebellion should be quelled, Alfred Cumming would take the place of Brigham Young as territorial governor. The resulting conflict is known as the Utah War, nicknamed \"Buchanan\\'s Blunder\" by the Mormon leaders.\\n In September 1857, about 120 American settlers of the Baker–Fancher wagon train, en route to California from Arkansas, were murdered by Utah Territorial Militia and some Paiute Native Americans in the Mountain Meadows massacre.[37]\\n Before troops led by Albert Sidney Johnston entered the territory, Brigham Young ordered all residents of Salt Lake City to evacuate southward to Utah Valley and sent out the Nauvoo Legion to delay the government\\'s advance.

By agreement with Young, Johnston established Camp Floyd, 40 miles (60\\xa0km) away from Salt Lake City to the southwest.\\n Salt Lake City was the last link of the First Transcontinental Telegraph, completed in October 1861. Brigham Young was among the first to send a message, along with Abraham Lincoln and other officials.\\n Because of the American Civil War, federal troops were pulled out of Utah Territory in 1861. This was a boon to the local economy as the army sold everything in camp for pennies on the dollar before marching back east to join the war. The territory was then left in LDS hands until Patrick E. Connor arrived with a regiment of California volunteers in 1862. Connor established Fort Douglas just 3 miles (4.8\\xa0km) east of Salt Lake City and encouraged his people to discover mineral deposits to bring more non-Mormons into the territory. Minerals were discovered in Tooele County and miners began to flock to the territory.\\n Beginning in 1865, Utah's Black Hawk War developed into the deadliest conflict in the territory's history. Chief Antonga Black Hawk died in 1870, but fights continued to break out until additional federal troops were sent in to suppress the Ghost Dance of 1872. The war is unique among Indian Wars because it was a three-way conflict, with mounted Timpanogos Utes led by Antonga Black Hawk fighting federal and LDS authorities.\\n On May 10, 1869, the First transcontinental railroad was completed at Promontory Summit, north of the Great Salt Lake.[38] The railroad brought increasing numbers of people into the territory and several influential businesspeople made fortunes there.\\n During the 1870s and 1880s laws were passed to punish polygamists due, in part, to stories from Utah. Notably, Ann Eliza Young—tenth wife to divorce Brigham Young, women's advocate, national lecturer, and author of Wife No.\\xa019 or My Life of Bondage—and Fanny Stenhouse, author of Tell It All: My Life in Mormonism, testified to the happiness of the very early Church members before polygamy.

His book gives a witnessed account of life in Utah, both the good and the bad. He finally left Utah and Mormonism after financial ruin occurred when Brigham Young sent Stenhouse to relocate to Ogden, Utah, according to Stenhouse, to take over his thriving pro-Mormon Salt Lake Telegraph newspaper. In addition to these testimonies, The Confessions of John D. Lee, written by John D. Lee—alleged \"Scapegoat\" for the Mountain Meadow Massacre—also came out in 1877. The corroborative testimonies coming out of Utah from Mormons and former Mormons influenced Congress and the people of the United States.\\n In the 1890 Manifesto, the LDS Church banned polygamy. When Utah applied for statehood again, it was accepted. One of the conditions for granting Utah statehood was that a ban on polygamy be written into the state constitution. This was a condition required of other western states that were admitted into the Union later. Statehood was officially granted on January 4, 1896.\\n \\n 20th century to present \\n  Santa Clara, Utah Beginning in the early 20th century, with the establishment of such national parks as Bryce Canyon National Park and Zion National Park, Utah became known for its natural beauty. Southern Utah became a popular filming spot for arid, rugged scenes featured in the popular mid-century western film genre. From such films, most US residents recognize such natural landmarks as Delicate Arch and \"the Mittens\" of Monument Valley.[39] During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, with the construction of the Interstate highway system, accessibility to the southern scenic areas was made easier.\\n Since the establishment of Alta Ski Area in 1939 and the subsequent development of several ski resorts in the state\\'s mountains, Utah\\'s skiing has become world-renowned.

Preparation for the Olympics spurred the development of the light-rail system in the Salt Lake Valley, known as TRAX, and the reconstruction of the freeway system around the city.\\n In 1957, Utah created the Utah State Parks Commission with four parks. Today, Utah State Parks manages 43 parks and several undeveloped areas totaling over 95,000 acres (380\\xa0km2) of land and more than 1,000,000 acres (4,000\\xa0km2) of water.

Utah State Parks is also home to the state\\'s off highway vehicle office, state boating office, and the trails program.[42]\\n During the late 20th century, the state grew quickly. In the 1970s growth was phenomenal in the suburbs of the Wasatch Front. Sandy was one of the fastest-growing cities in the country at that time. Today, many areas of Utah continue to see boom-time growth. Northern Davis, southern and western Salt Lake, Summit, eastern Tooele, Utah, Wasatch, and Washington counties are all growing very quickly. Management of transportation and urbanization are major issues in politics, as development consumes agricultural land and wilderness areas and transportation is a major reason for poor air quality in Utah.\\n On March 18, 2020, Utah suffered a 5.7 magnitude earthquake originating 3.7\\xa0mi (6.0\\xa0km) northeast of Magna, near Salt Lake City.[43]\\n \\n \\n Geography and geology \\n Geography of Utah Geology of Utah List of canyons and gorges in Utah List of Utah counties List of earthquakes in Utah  Utah is known for its natural diversity and is home to features ranging from arid deserts with dunes to thriving pine forests in mountain valleys.

Only three U.S. states (Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming) have exclusively latitude and longitude lines as boundaries.\\n One of Utah's defining characteristics is the variety of its terrain. Running down the middle of the state's northern third is the Wasatch Range, which rises to heights of almost 12,000\\xa0ft (3,700\\xa0m) above sea level. Utah is home to world-renowned ski resorts made popular by light, fluffy snow and winter storms that regularly dump up to three feet of it overnight.

The highest point in the state, Kings Peak, at 13,528 feet (4,123\\xa0m),[44] lies within the Uinta Mountains.\\n At the western base of the Wasatch Range is the Wasatch Front, a series of valleys and basins that are home to the most populous parts of the state. It stretches approximately from Brigham City at the north end to Nephi at the south end. Approximately 75 percent of the state's population lives in this corridor, and population growth is rapid.\\n Western Utah is a mostly arid desert with a basin and range topography. Small mountain ranges and rugged terrain punctuate the landscape. The Bonneville Salt Flats are an exception, being comparatively flat as a result of once forming the bed of ancient Lake Bonneville. Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake, and Rush Lake are all remnants of this ancient freshwater lake,[45] which once covered most of the eastern Great Basin. West of the Great Salt Lake, stretching to the Nevada border, lies the arid Great Salt Lake Desert.

Although St. George receives only about 3 inches (76\\xa0mm) per year, Salt Lake City sees about 60 inches (1,524\\xa0mm), enhanced by the lake-effect snow from the Great Salt Lake, which increases snowfall totals to the south, southeast, and east of the lake.\\n Some areas of the Wasatch Range in the path of the lake effect receive up to 500 inches (1,270\\xa0cm) per year. This micro climate of enhanced snowfall from the Great Salt Lake spans the entire proximity of the lake. The cottonwood canyons adjacent to Salt Lake City are located in the right position to receive more precipitation from the lake.[49] The consistently deep powder snow led Utah\\'s ski industry to adopt the slogan \"the Greatest Snow on Earth\" in the 1980s. In the winter, temperature inversions are a common phenomenon across Utah\\'s low basins and valleys, leading to thick haze and fog that can last for weeks at a time, especially in the Uintah Basin. Although at other times of year, its air quality is good, winter inversions give Salt Lake City some of the worst wintertime pollution in the country.\\n Previous studies have indicated a widespread decline in snowpack over Utah accompanied by a decline in the snow–snow-precipitation ratio while anecdotal evidence claims have been put forward that measured changes in Utah\\'s snowpack are spurious and do not reflect actual change. A 2012 study[50] found that the proportion of winter (January–March) precipitation falling as snow has decreased by nine percent during the last half century, a combined result of a significant increase in rainfall and a minor decrease in snowfall. Meanwhile, observed snow depth across Utah has decreased and is accompanied by consistent decreases in snow cover and surface albedo. Weather systems with the potential to produce precipitation in Utah have decreased in number with those producing snowfall decreasing at a considerably greater rate.[51]\\n  Rose Park, Salt Lake City Utah\\'s temperatures are extreme, with cold temperatures in winter due to its elevation, and very hot summers statewide (except mountain areas and high mountain valleys).

Since 1918 there have been 29 counties in the state, ranging from 298 to 7,819 square miles (772 to 20,300\\xa0km2).\\n Total Counties: 29 Total 2020 population: 3,271,616[193] Total state area: 82,154\\xa0sq\\xa0mi (212,780\\xa0km2) \\n Women\\'s rights \\n Women\\'s suffrage in Utah Utah granted full voting rights to women in 1870, 26 years before becoming a state. Among all U.S. states, only Wyoming granted suffrage to women earlier.[194] However, in 1887 the initial Edmunds-Tucker Act was passed by Congress to curtail Mormon influence in the territorial government. One of the provisions of the Act was the repeal of women\\'s suffrage; full suffrage was not returned until Utah was admitted to the Union in 1896.\\n Utah is one of the 15 states that have not ratified the U.S. Equal Rights Amendment.[195] Abortion in Utah is legal prior to the 18th week of pregnancy.[196]\\n \\n Free-range parenting \\n In March 2018, Utah passed the United States\\' first \"free-range parenting\" bill. The bill was signed into law by Republican Governor Gary Herbert and states that parents who allow their children to engage in certain activities without supervision are not considered neglectful.[197][198]\\n \\n Constitution \\n Constitution of Utah The constitution of Utah was enacted on May 8, 1895.[199] Notably, the constitution outlawed polygamy, as requested by Congress when Utah had applied for statehood, and reestablished the territorial practice of women\\'s suffrage.

Georgia, when Gary Gilmore was executed by firing squad in 1977.[202] Utah is one of only two states to have ever carried out executions by firing squad, and the only one to do so after the moratorium ended.[203]\\n \\n Alcohol, tobacco, and gambling laws \\n List of breweries, wineries, and distilleries in Utah List of alcohol laws of the United States Utah's laws regarding alcohol, tobacco and gambling are strict. Utah is an alcoholic beverage control state. The Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control regulates the sale of alcohol; wine and spirituous liquors may be purchased only at state liquor stores, and local laws may prohibit the sale of beer and other alcoholic beverages on Sundays. The state bans the sale of fruity alcoholic drinks at grocery stores and convenience stores. The law states that such drinks must now have new state-approved labels on the front of the products that contain capitalized letters in bold type telling consumers the drinks contain alcohol and at what percentage. Utah is the only state that imposes a maximum blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.05% for drivers, as opposed to the 0.08% limit in other states.[204] The Utah Indoor Clean Air Act is a statewide smoking ban that prohibits it in many public places.[205] Utah and Hawaii are the only two states in the United States to outlaw all forms of gambling.\\n \\n Same-sex marriage \\n Same-sex marriage in Utah Same-sex marriage became legal in Utah on December 20, 2013, when U.S. District Court Judge Robert J. Shelby  issued a ruling in Kitchen v. Herbert.[206][207] As of close of business December 26, more than 1,225 marriage licenses were issued, with at least 74 percent, or 905 licenses, issued to gay and lesbian couples.[208] The Utah Attorney General's office was granted a stay of the ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on January 6, 2014, while the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals considered the case.[209] On October 6, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court declined a writ of certiorari, and the 10th Circuit Court issued their\"),\n",

Same-sex marriages commenced again in Utah that day.[210]\\n \\n LGBT rights \\n LGBTQ rights in Utah [edit] The rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people in the U.S. state of Utah have significantly evolved in the 21st century. Protective laws have become increasingly enacted since 2014, despite the state's reputation as socially conservative and highly religious. Utah's anti-sodomy law was invalidated in 2003 by Lawrence v. Texas, and fully repealed by the state legislature in 2019. Same-sex marriage has been legal since the state's ban was ruled unconstitutional by federal courts in 2014. In addition, statewide anti-discrimination laws now cover sexual orientation and gender identity in employment and housing, and the use of conversion therapy on minors is prohibited. In spite of this, there are still a few differences between the treatment of LGBTQ people and the rest of the population, and the rights of transgender youth are restricted.[211][212]\\n Public Religion Research Institute [213] \\n Politics \\n Political party strength in Utah United States presidential elections in Utah  Utah State Capitol  In the late 19th century, the federal government took issue with polygamy in the LDS Church. The LDS Church discontinued plural marriage in 1890, and in 1896 Utah gained admission to the Union. Many new people settled in the area soon after the Mormon pioneers. Relations have often been strained between the LDS population and the non-LDS population.[215] These tensions have played a large part in Utah's history (Liberal Party vs. People's Party).\\n Utah votes predominantly Republican. Self-identified Latter-day Saints are more likely to vote for the Republican ticket than non-Mormons. Utah is one of the most Republican states in the nation.[216][217] Utah was the single most Republican-leaning state in the country in every presidential election from 1976 to 2004, measured by the percentage point margin between the Republican and Democratic candidates. In 2008 Utah was only the third-most Republican state (after Wyoming and Oklahoma), but in 2012, with Mormon Mitt Romney atop the Republican ticket, Utah returned to its position as the most Republican state. However, the 2016 presidential election result saw Republican Donald Trump carry the state (marking the thirteenth consecutive win by the Republican presidential candidate) with only a plurality, the first time this happened since 1992.\\n\"),\n",

Ben McAdams is the most recent Democrat to represent Utah in Congress, representing the 4th congressional district, based in Salt Lake City, from 2019 to 2021. He lost re-election to Burgess Owens, a Republican, in 2020. After Jon Huntsman Jr. resigned to serve as U.S. Ambassador to China in 2009, Gary Herbert was sworn in as governor on August 11, 2009. Herbert was elected to serve out the remainder of the term in a special election in 2010, defeating Democratic nominee Salt Lake County Mayor Peter Corroon with 64% of the vote. He won election to a full four-year term in 2012, defeating the Democrat Peter Cooke with 68% of the vote.\\n The LDS Church maintains an official policy of neutrality about political parties and candidates.[151]\\n In the 1970s, then-Apostle Ezra Taft Benson was quoted by the Associated Press that it would be difficult for a faithful Latter-day Saint to be a liberal Democrat.[218] Although the LDS Church has officially repudiated such statements on many occasions, Democratic candidates—including LDS Democrats—believe Republicans capitalize on the perception that the Republican Party is doctrinally superior.[219] Political scientist and pollster Dan Jones explains this disparity by noting that the national Democratic Party is associated with liberal positions on gay marriage and abortion, both of which the LDS Church is against.[220] The Republican Party in heavily Mormon Utah County presents itself as the superior choice for Latter-day Saints. Even though Utah Democratic candidates are predominantly LDS, socially conservative, and pro-life, no Democrat has won in Utah County since 1994.[221]\\n David Magleby, dean of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Brigham Young University, a lifelong Democrat and a political analyst, asserts that the Republican Party has more conservative positions than the LDS Church. Magleby argues that the locally conservative Democrats are in better accord with LDS doctrine.[222] For example, the Republican Party of Utah opposes almost all abortions while Utah Democrats take a more liberal approach, although more conservative than their national counterparts. On Second Amendment issues, the state GOP has been at odds with the LDS Church's position opposing concealed firearms in places of worship and public spaces.\\n In 1998, the church expressed concern that Utahns perceived the Republican Party as an LDS\"),\n",

Compared to other Republican-dominated states in the Mountain West such as Idaho and Wyoming, Utah politics have a more moralistic and less libertarian character, according to David Magleby.[223]\\n About 80% of Utah's Legislature are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,[224] while members account for 61 percent of the population.[225] Since becoming a state in 1896, Utah has had only two non-Mormon governors.[226]\\n In 2006, the legislature passed legislation aimed at banning joint custody for a non-biological parent of a child. The custody measure passed the legislature and was vetoed by the governor, a reciprocal benefits supporter.\\n Carbon County's Democrats are generally made up of members of the large Greek, Italian, and Southeastern European communities, whose ancestors migrated in the early 20th century to work in the extensive mining industry. The views common amongst this group are heavily influenced by labor politics, particularly of the New Deal Era.[227]\\n The state's most Republican areas tend to be Utah County, which is the home to Brigham Young University (BYU) in the city of Provo, and nearly all the rural counties.[228][229] These areas generally hold socially conservative views in line with that of the national Religious Right. The most Democratic areas of the state lie currently in and around Salt Lake City proper.\\n The state has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1964. Historically, Republican presidential nominees score one of their best margins of victory here. Utah was the Republicans' best state in the 1976,[230] 1980,[231] 1984,[232] 1988,[233] 1996,[234] 2000,[235] 2004[236] and 2012 elections. In 1992, Utah was the only state in the nation where Democratic candidate Bill Clinton finished behind both Republican candidate George HW Bush and Independent candidate Ross Perot.[237] In 2004, Republican George W. Bush won every county in the state and Utah gave him his largest margin of victory of any state. He won the state's five electoral votes by a margin of 46 percentage points with 71.5% of the vote. In the 1996 Presidential elections the Republican candidate received a smaller 54% of the vote while the Democrat earned 34%\"),\n",

The original team of that name, which shared ownership with RSL and also played at America First Field, started NWSL play in 2018.[246] Due to fallout from controversies surrounding RSL's ownership, leading to the club's eventual sale, RSL shuttered the Royals after the 2020 season, selling its player-related assets to a new Kansas City franchise.[247] The NWSL gave the new RSL owners an option for a new NWSL franchise, which was exercised in 2023 with the announcement that the Royals would return in 2024 and play at America First Field.[248] Before the creation of the Royals, RSL's main women's side had been Real Salt Lake Women, which began play in the Women's Premier Soccer League in 2008 and moved to United Women's Soccer in 2016.

Its origins are in musical forms that developed as a result of the enslavement of African Americans prior to the American Civil War.[1][2] It has been said that \"every genre that is born from America has black roots.\"[3]\\n White slave owners subjugated their slaves physically, mentally, and spiritually through brutal and demeaning acts.[4] White Americans considered African Americans separate and unequal for centuries, going to extraordinary lengths to keep them oppressed. African-American slaves created a distinctive type of music that played an important role in the era of enslavement. Slave songs, commonly known as work songs, were used to combat the hardships of the physical labor. Work songs were also used to communicate with other slaves without the slave owner hearing. The  song \"Wade in the Water\" was sung by slaves to warn others trying to leave to use the water to obscure their trail. Following the Civil War, African Americans employed playing European music in military bands developed a new style called ragtime that gradually evolved into jazz. Jazz incorporated the sophisticated polyrhythmic structure of dance and folk music of peoples from western and Sub-Saharan Africa. These musical forms had a wide-ranging influence on the development of music within the United States and around the world during the 20th century.[5][6]\\n Analyzing African music through the lens of European musicology can leave out much of the cultural use of sound and methods of music making. Some methods of African music making are translated more clearly though the music itself, and not in written form.[7]\\n Blues and ragtime were developed during the late 19th century through the fusion of West African vocalizations, which employed the natural harmonic series and blue notes. \"If one considers the five criteria given by Waterman as cluster characteristics for West African music, one finds that three have been well documented as being characteristic of Afro-American music. Call-and-response organizational procedures, dominance of a percussive approach to music, and off-beat phrasing of melodic accents have been cited as typical of the genre in virtually every study of any kind of African-American music from work songs, field or street calls, shouts, and spirituals to blues and jazz.\"[8]\\n The roots of American popular music are deeply intertwined with African-American contributions and innovation.

The earliest jazz and blues recordings emerged in the 1910s, marking the beginning of a transformative era in music. These genres were heavily influenced by African musical traditions, and they served as the foundation for many musical developments in the years to come.\\n As African-American musicians continued to shape the musical landscape, the 1940s witnessed the emergence of rhythm and blues (R&B). R&B became a pivotal genre, blending elements of jazz, blues, and gospel, and it laid the groundwork for the evolution of rock and roll in the following decade.[9]\\n \\n Historic traits \\n [edit]  The Banjo Lesson Henry Ossawa Tanner Most slaves arrived to the Americas from the western coast of Africa.[10] This area encompasses modern-day Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Gambia and parts of Sierra Leone.[10] Harmonic and rhythmic features from these areas, European musical instrumentation, and the chattel slavery forced upon Black Americans all contributed to their music.[11][12][13]\\n Many of the characteristic musical forms that define African-American music have historical precedents. These earlier forms include: field hollers, beat boxing, work song, Spoken Word, rapping, scatting, call and response, vocality (or special vocal effect: guttural effects, interpolated vocality, falsetto, melisma, vocal rhythmization), improvisation, blue notes, polyrhythms (syncopation, concrescence, tension, improvisation, percussion, swung note), texture (antiphony, homophony, polyphony, heterophony) and harmony (vernacular progressions; complex, multi-part harmony, as in spirituals, Doo Wop, and barbershop music).[14]\\n American composer Olly Wilson outlines \"heterogeneous sound ideals\"[15] that define traditional and common patterns in African Music, such as the use of timbre, pitch, volume and duration, and the incorporation of the body in making music. His findings include uses of call-and-response and the importance of interjections from the audience to express satisfaction or dissatisfaction.[16] These heterogeneous sound ideals are also found in many other types of music.\\n White people sometimes taught black slaves to play Western instruments such as the fiddle and violin.[17]\\n Due to the fact that white colonizers viewed indigenous African religious practices that included drumming and dancing as idolatrous, the'),\n",

During the eighteenth century, the slaves\\' informal assemblies in praise houses and brush arbor meetings featured songs and chants such as the ring shout, a circular dance accompanied by chanting and handclapping. On occasion, the participants would enter into ecstatic trances.[18]\\n \\n History \\n [edit] \\n 18th century \\n [edit] Work song §\\xa0African-American work songs In the late 18th century folk spirituals originated among Southern slaves following their conversion to Christianity. Slaves reinterpreted the practice of Christianity in a way that had meaning to them as Africans in America. They often sang the spirituals in groups as they worked the plantation fields. African-American spirituals (Negro Spirituals) were created in invisible churches and regular Black churches. The hymns, melody, and rhythms were similar to songs heard in West Africa. Enslaved and free blacks created their own words and tunes. Themes include the hardships of slavery and the hope of freedom.[19]\\n Spirituals from the era of slavery are called Slave Shout Songs. These shout songs are sung today by Gullah Geechee people and other African Americans in churches and praise houses. During slavery, these songs were coded messages that spoke of escape from slavery on the Underground Railroad and were sung by enslaved African Americans in plantation fields to send coded messages to other slaves, unbeknownst to the slaveholders.[20] According to musicologist and historian Eric Sean Crawford[21] who published Gullah Spirituals: The Sound of Freedom and Protest in the South Carolina Sea Islands, Gullah music influenced all genres of American music. Crawford said: \"All genres of music have been influenced by Gullah Geechee spirituals. This music\\'s bent notes, syncopated rhythms, and improvisational qualities heavily influenced gospel and country music. These musical traits found a secular home in the blues, jazz, and even later popular styles like hip hop\".[22] Scholar LeRhonda S. Manigault-Bryant explained Gullah spirituals are sacred music that connects Black Americans to ancestral spirits. She said: \"I am suggesting that low country sacred music simultaneously takes on a cyclical and linear quality, which is best exemplified in the use of the low country clap, and the repetition of verses that literally push a song forward to invoke The Spirit.'),\n",

In West Africa, drums are used for communication, celebration, and spiritual ceremonies. West African people enslaved in the United States continued to make drums to send coded messages to other slaves across plantations. The making and use of drums by enslaved Africans was outlawed after the Stono Rebellion in South Carolina in 1739.[24] Enslaved African Americans used drums to send coded messages to start slave revolts, and white slaveholders banned the creation and use of drums. After the banning of drums, slaves made rhythmic music by slapping their knees, thighs, arms and other body parts, a practice called pattin Juba.[25][26] The Juba dance was originally brought by Kongo slaves to Charleston, South Carolina, and became an African-American plantation dance performed by slaves during gatherings when rhythm instruments were prohibited.[27][28]     \\n  Folk spirituals, unlike much white gospel, were often spirited. Slaves added dancing (later known as \"the shout\") and other body movements to the singing. They also changed the melodies and rhythms of psalms and hymns, by speeding up the tempo, adding repeated refrains and choruses, and replacing texts with new ones that often combined English and African words and phrases. Originally passed down orally, folk spirituals have been central in the lives of African Americans for more than three centuries, serving religious, cultural, social, political, and historical functions.[29]\\n Folk spirituals were spontaneously created and performed in a repetitive, improvised style. The most common song structures are the call-and-response (\"Blow, Gabriel\") and repetitive choruses (\"He Rose from the Dead\"). The call-and-response is an alternating exchange between the soloist and the other singers. The soloist usually improvises a line to which the other singers respond, repeating the same phrase. Song interpretation incorporates the interjections of moans, cries, hollers, and changing vocal timbres, and can be accompanied by hand clapping and foot-stomping.\\n The Smithsonian Institution Folkways Recordings have samples of African American slave shout songs.['),\n",

The banjo, of African origin, became a popular instrument, and its African-derived rhythms were incorporated into popular songs by Stephen Foster and other songwriters. Over time the banjo\\'s construction adopted some European traditions such as a flat fingerboard. Some banjos had five strings, in contrast to the West African three-string version. This resulted in the creation of several different types of banjos in the United States.[31]\\n In the 1830s, the Second Great Awakening led to a rise in Christian revivals, especially among African Americans. Drawing on traditional work songs, enslaved African Americans originated and performed a wide variety of spirituals and other Christian music. Some of these songs were coded messages of subversion against slaveholders, or signals to escape. For example, Harriet Tubman sang coded messages to her mother and other slaves in the field to let them know she was escaping on the Underground Railroad. Tubman sang: \"I\\'m sorry I\\'m going to leave you, farewell, oh farewell; But I\\'ll meet you in the morning, farewell, oh farewell, I\\'ll meet you in the morning, I\\'m bound for the promised land, On the other side of Jordan, Bound for the Promised Land.\"[32][33][34]\\n During the period after the Civil War, the spread of African-American music continued. The Fisk University Jubilee Singers first toured in 1871. Artists including Jack Delaney helped revolutionize post-war African-American music in the central-east of the United States. In the following years, professional \"jubilee\" troops formed and toured. The first black musical-comedy troupe, Hyers Sisters Comic Opera Co., was organized in 1876.[35] In the last half of the 19th century, barbershops often served as community centers, where men would gather. Barbershop quartets originated with African-American men socializing in barbershops; they would harmonize while waiting their turn, singing spirituals, folk songs and popular songs. This generated a new style of unaccompanied four-part, close-harmony singing. Later, white minstrel singers stole the style, and in the early days of the'),\n",

By the end of the 19th century, African-American music was an integral part of mainstream American culture.\\n \\n Early 20th century (1900s–1930s) \\n [edit]  Clay Center In a groundbreaking moment in 1898, Broadway witnessed the debut of the first musical created by African Americans, courtesy of Bob Cole and Billy Johnson. The musical landscape saw another milestone in 1890 with the first recording by black musicians—Bert Williams and George Walker—highlighting music from Broadway productions. Theodore Drury played a pivotal role in nurturing black talent in opera, establishing the Drury Opera Company in 1900. Despite its short run until 1908, the company left an indelible mark as the pioneer in black participation within opera. Fast forward to 1911, where Scott Joplin\\'s trailblazing ragtime-folk opera, Treemonisha, took center stage, adding a unique and vibrant chapter to the history of African American contributions to the musical realm.[36]\\n The early part of the 20th century saw a rise in popularity of blues and jazz. African-American music at this time was classed as \"race music\".[37] Ralph Peer, musical director at Okeh Records, put records made by \"foreign\" groups under that label. At the time \"race\" was a term commonly used by the African-American press to speak of the community as a whole with an empowering point of view, as a person of \"race\" was one involved in fighting for equal rights.[38] Ragtime performers such as Scott Joplin became popular and some were associated with the Harlem Renaissance and early civil rights activists. White and Latino performers of African-American music were also visible. African-American music was often altered and diluted to be more palatable for white audiences, who would not have accepted black performers, leading to genres like swing music.\\n By the turn of the 20th century African Americans were becoming part of classical music as well. Originally excluded from major symphony orchestras, black musicians could study in music conservatories that had been founded in the 1860s, such as the Oberlin School of Music, National Conservatory of Music, and the New England Conservatory.[39] Black people also formed symphony orchestras in major cities such as Chicago, New Orleans, and Philadelphia.

Various black orchestras began to perform regularly in the late 1890s and the early 20th century. In 1906, the first incorporated black orchestra was established in Philadelphia.[40] In the early 1910s, all-black music schools, such as the Music School Settlement for Colored and the Martin-Smith School of Music, were founded in New York.[41]\\n The Music School Settlement for Colored became a sponsor of the Clef Club orchestra in New York. The Clef Club Symphony Orchestra attracted both black and white audiences to concerts at Carnegie Hall from 1912 to 1915. Conducted by James Reese Europe and William H. Tyers, the orchestra included banjos, mandolins, and baritone horns. Concerts featured music written by black composers, notably Harry T. Burleigh and Will Marion Cook. Other annual black concert series include the William Hackney\\'s \"All-Colored Composers\" concerts in Chicago and the Atlanta Colored Music Festivals.[42]\\n The return of the black musical to Broadway occurred in 1921 with Sissle and Eubie Blake\\'s Shuffle Along. In 1927, a concert survey of black music was performed at Carnegie Hall including jazz, spirituals and the symphonic music of W. C. Handy\\'s Orchestra and the Jubilee Singers. The first major film musical with a black cast was King Vidor\\'s Hallelujah of 1929. African-American performers were featured in the musical Show Boat (which had a part written for Paul Robeson and a chorus of Jubilee Singers), and especially all-black operas such as Porgy and Bess and Virgil Thomson\\'s Four Saints in Three Acts of 1934.\\n The first symphony by a black composer to be performed by a major orchestra was William Grant Still\\'s Afro-American Symphony (1930) by the New York Philharmonic. Florence Beatrice Price\\'s Symphony in E minor was performed in 1933 by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.[43] In 1934, William Dawson\\'s Negro Folk Symphony was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra.[44]\\n \\n Mid-20th century (1940s–1960s) \\n [edit]  Marilyn Horne Henry Lewis Carl Van Vechten Billboard started making a separate list of hit records for African-American music in October 1942 with the \"Harlem Hit Parade\", which was changed in 1945 to \"Race Records\", and then in 1949 to \"Rhythm and Blues Records\".[45][46]\\n By'),\n",

In 1955, Thurman Ruth persuaded a gospel group to sing in the Apollo Theater. This presentation of gospel music in a secular setting was successful, and he arranged gospel caravans that traveled around the country playing venues that rhythm and blues singers had popularized. Meanwhile, jazz performers began to move away from swing towards music with more intricate arrangements, more improvisation, and technically challenging forms. This culminated in bebop, the modal jazz of Miles Davis, and the free jazz of Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane.\\n African-American musicians in the 1940s and 1950s were developing rhythm and blues into rock and roll, which featured a strong backbeat. Prominent exponents of this style included Louis Jordan and Wynonie Harris. Rock and roll music became commercially successful with recordings of white musicians, however, such as Bill Haley and Elvis Presley, playing a guitar-based fusion of black rock and roll and rockabilly. Rock music became more associated with white artists, although some black performers such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley had commercial success.\\n  In 2017, National Public Radio wrote about the career of Sister Rosetta Tharpe and concluded with these comments: Tharpe \"was a gospel singer at heart who became a celebrity by forging a new path musically ... Through her unforgettable voice and gospel swing crossover style, Tharpe influenced a generation of musicians including Aretha Franklin, Chuck Berry and countless others ... She was, and is, an unmatched artist.\"[47]\\n As the 1940s came to a close, other African Americans endeavored to concertize as classical musicians in an effort to transcend racial and nationalistic barriers in the post-war era. In 1968 Henry Lewis became the first African-American instrumentalist in a leading American symphony orchestra, an early \"musical ambassador\" in support of cultural diplomacy in Europe, and the first African-American conductor of a major American symphonic ensemble in 1968.[48][49][50][51]\\n The term \"rock and roll\" had a strong sexual connotation in jump blues and R&B, but when DJ Alan Freed referred to rock and roll on mainstream radio in the mid 50s, \"the sexual component had been dialed down enough that it simply became an acceptable term for'),\n",

It\\'s Still Rhythm and Blues\". The author states that the \"two terms were used interchangeably\", until about 1957.[53]\\n Fats Domino was not convinced that there was any new genre. In 1957 he said: \"What they call rock \\'n\\' roll now is rhythm and blues. I\\'ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans\".[54] According to Rolling Stone, \"this is a valid statement ... all Fifties rockers, black and white, country born and city bred, were fundamentally influenced by R&B, the black popular music of the late Forties and early Fifties\".[55] Elvis Presley\\'s recognition of the importance of artists such as Fats Domino was significant, according to a 2017 article: the \"championing of black musicians as part of a narrative that saw many positives in growing young white interest in African American-based musical styles\".[56] At a press event in 1969, Presley introduced Fats Domino, and said, \"that\\'s the real King of Rock \\'n\\' Roll\" ... a huge influence on me when I started out\".[57]\\n By the mid-1950s, many R&B songs were getting \"covered\" by white artists and the recordings got more airplay on the mainstream radio stations. For example, \"Presley quickly covered \"Tutti Frutti\" ...So did Pat Boone\", according to New Yorker. \"In 1956, seventy-six per cent of top R.&.B. songs also made the pop chart; in 1957, eighty-seven per cent made the pop chart; in 1958, it was ninety-four per cent. The marginal market had become the main market, and the majors had got into the act.\"[58]\\n The 1950s marked a significant uptick in the allure of  blues, captivating audiences both in the US and across the pond in the UK, reminiscent of early 20th-century styles.

Doo-wop, often featuring solo artists with backing groups, emphasized lead singers who played a prominent role in the musical arrangement. Simultaneously, a secularized version of American gospel music, known as soul ,emerged in the mid-1950s, led by trailblazers like Ray Charles,[59] Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke.[60] This soulful wave had a profound impact, influencing not only surf music but also paving the way for chart-topping girl groups like The Angels and The Shangri-Las. In a dance revolution, 1959 saw Hank Ballard releasing a song tailored for the new dance craze, \"The Twist,\" which would become a sensation defining the early \\'60s.[61]\\n In 1959, Berry Gordy founded Motown Records, the first record label to primarily feature African-American artists, which aimed at achieving crossover success. The label developed an innovative, and commercially successful, style of soul music with distinctive pop elements. Its early roster included The Miracles, Martha and the Vandellas, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, and The Supremes.[62] Black divas such as Aretha Franklin became \\'60s crossover stars. In the UK, British blues became a gradually mainstream phenomenon, returning to the United States in the form of the British Invasion, a group of bands led by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones who performed blues and R&B-inspired pop with both traditional and modern aspects. WGIV in Charlotte, North Carolina, was one of a few radio stations dedicated to African-American music that started during this period.\\n The British Invasion knocked many black artists off the US pop charts, although some, like Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin and a number of Motown artists, continued to do well. Soul music, however, remained popular among black people through new forms such as funk, developed out of the innovations of James Brown.[63] In 1961, 11-year-old Stevland Hardaway Morris made his first record under Motown\\'s Tamla label as Stevie Wonder.[64]\\n In 1964 the Civil Rights Act outlawed major forms of discrimination towards African Americans and women. As tensions began to diminish, more African-American musicians crossed over into the mainstream.

Psychedelic soul, a mix of psychedelic rock and soul began to flourish with the 1960s culture. Even more popular among black people, and with more crossover appeal, was album-oriented soul in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which revolutionized African-American music. The genre's intelligent and introspective lyrics, often with a socially aware tone, were created by artists such as Marvin Gaye in What's Going On, and Stevie Wonder in Innervisions.\\n \\n 1970s \\n [edit] Progressive soul Hip hop music In the 1970s, album-oriented soul continued its popularity while musicians such as Smokey Robinson helped turn it into Quiet Storm music. Funk evolved into two strands, a pop-soul-jazz-bass fusion pioneered by Sly & the Family Stone, and a more psychedelic fusion epitomized by George Clinton and his P-Funk ensemble. Disco evolved from black musicians creating soul music with an up-tempo melody. Isaac Hayes, Barry White, Donna Summer, and others helped popularize disco, which gained mainstream success.\\n Some African-American artists including The Jackson 5, Roberta Flack, Teddy Pendergrass, Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder, The O'Jays, Gladys Knight & the Pips, and Earth, Wind & Fire found crossover audiences, while white listeners preferred country rock, singer-songwriters, stadium rock, soft rock, glam rock, and, to some degree, heavy metal and punk rock.\\n During the 1970s, The Dozens, an urban African-American tradition of using playful rhyming ridicule, developed into street jive in the early '70s, which in turn inspired hip-hop by the late 1970s. Spoken-word artists such as The Watts Prophets, The Last Poets, Gil Scott-Heron and Melvin Van Peebles were some innovators of early hip-hop.

Jackson paved the way for other successful crossover black solo artists such as Prince, Lionel Richie, Luther Vandross, Tina Turner, Whitney Houston, and Janet Jackson (Michael's sister). Pop and dance-soul of this era inspired new jack swing by the end of the decade.[67]\\n Hip-hop spread across the country and diversified. Techno, dance, Miami bass, post-disco, Chicago house, Los Angeles hardcore and Washington, D.C. Go-go developed during this period, with only Miami bass achieving mainstream success. Before long, Miami bass was relegated primarily to the Southeastern US, while Chicago house had made strong headway on college campuses and dance arenas (i.e. the warehouse sound, the rave). Washington's Go-go garnered modest national attention with songs such as E.U.'s Da Butt (1988), but  proved to be a mostly regional phenomena. Chicago house sound had expanded into the Detroit music environment and began using more electronic and industrial sounds, creating Detroit techno, acid, and jungle. The combination of these experimental, usually DJ-oriented, sounds with the multiethnic NYC disco sound from the 1970s and 1980s created a brand of music that was most appreciated in large discothèques in large cities. European audiences embraced this kind of electronic dance music with more enthusiasm than their North American counterparts.[citation needed]\\n  DJ Jazzy Jeff From about 1986, rap entered the mainstream with Run-D.M.C.'s Raising Hell, and the Beastie Boys' Licensed to Ill.

This festival \"celebrated African-American music and culture and promoted the continued politics of Black pride\".[87] At 3\\xa0pm on Sundays from June 29, 1969, to August 24, 1969, artists would perform to an audience of tens of thousands of people.[87] Such artists that performed were Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, B.B. King, Sly and the Family Stone, The 5th Dimension, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Mahalia Jackson, and many others.[87]\\n \\n Economic impact \\n [edit] Record stores played a vital role in African-American communities for many decades. In the 1960s and 1970s, between 500 and 1,000 black-owned record stores operated in the American South, and probably twice as many in the United States as a whole. According to The Political economy of Black Music By Norman Kelley,\"Black music exists in a neo-colonial relationship with the $12 billion music industry, which consist of six record companies.\" African-American entrepreneurs embraced record stores as key vehicles for economic empowerment and critical public spaces for black consumers at a time that many black-owned businesses were closing amid desegregation.[88] Countless African Americans have worked as musical performers, club owners, radio deejays, concert promoters, and record label owners. Many companies use African-American music to sell their products. Companies like Coca-Cola, Nike, and Pepsi have used African-American music in advertising.[89]\\n \\n International influence \\n [edit] Jazz and hip-hop traveled to Africa and Asia and influenced other genres of African and Asian Music.[90] Many state that without African-American music, there would be no American music.[91]  The songs that Africans brought to America created a foundation for American music.[91] The textural styles, slang and African-American'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_African-American_music.txt'}, page_content=' America created a foundation for American music.[91] The textural styles, slang and African-American Vernacular English influenced American pop culture and global culture. The way African Americans dress in hip-hop videos and how African Americans talk is copied in the American market and the global market.[92][93] White Australian rapper Iggy Azalea culturally appropriates black music and uses black speech in her music.[94] White Canadian singer Justin Bieber has admitted to be influenced by black culture and black music.[95]\\n \\n Afrobeat \\n [edit] Afrobeat is a Nigerian music genre created by Nigerian artist Fela Kuti. Afrobeat began during the early twentieth century from Nigeria with a combination of Highlife, Yoruba music and jazz.[96] The years between the wars (1918–1939) were a particularly fertile time for the formation of pan-West African urban musical traditions.[97] Kuti fused traditional West African music with African-American music of Jazz, R&B, and other genres of West African and African-American music.[98] James Brown\\'s funk music, dance style, and African-American drumming influenced Afrobeat.[99] In London, Kuti joined jazz and rock bands, and returned to Nigeria, creating Afrobeat by fusing African-American and traditional Yoruba music with Highlife music. In 1969, Kuti toured the United States and became inspired by the political activism of African Americans. He studied the life of Malcolm X and was inspired by his pro-black speeches. This resulted in a change in Kuti\\'s message as he began discussing the political issues in Africa and Nigeria.[100] In contrast, \"Afrobeats\" is a term applied to a large range of genres popular all over Africa. Music referred to as Afrobeats, in contrast to Kuti, is frequently upbeat, digitally generated, and sung in English, West African, and pidgin languages. Kuti\\'s music was characterized by its political content and orchestral style whereas Afrobeats took influence from many musical themes found in R&B and Hip-Hop/Rap (Love, sex, drugs, money, hard times, fame).[101]\\n \\n Racial appropriation and insensitivity in K-pop music \\n [edit] Hip-hop came to Korea in the 1990s and developed into Korean hip-hop and Korean K-pop music.[102] Some Korean artists have appropriated African-American vernacular and other aspects of Black culture.[103'),\n",

Artist Zico has used the n-word in his music, and has claimed that he has a \"black soul.\"[105] As of 2020, within \"K-pop, blackface, mouthing or saying racial slurs, and purely aesthetic uses of Black culture and hairstyles\" were still common,[106] without necessarily understanding, honoring or crediting their African-American roots.[105] According to sources cited in a 2020 Guardian article, many K-pop artists do not show support for African-American social justice issues. \"[M]any international fans are waiting for the industry to develop a more sensitive, globalized understanding of race.\"[106] In Korean there are phrases that have been misconstrued to sound like the a racial slur. These include the phrase \"because of\" (니까), pronounced \\'nikka\\' and the word \"you\" or \"you\\'re\" (니가), pronounced \\'neega\\'.[107]\\n \\n See also \\n [edit] Music portal United States portal African-American culture African-American dance African American musical theater Groove Afro-Caribbean music Blackface Cultural appropriation Culture of Africa Culture of the United States Culture of the Southern United States Gandy dancer Juke joint List of musical genres of the African diaspora Music of Africa Music of the African diaspora Cajun music Creole music Indie soul Neo soul Music of Baltimore Music of Detroit Music of Georgia (U.S. state) Music of New Orleans Music of the United States Jewish music Mexican music National Museum of African American Music Romani music \\n References \\n [edit] ^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/'),\n",

Even countries that were relatively unaffected by the war such as Sweden (Record years) experienced considerable economic growth.\\n The boom established the conditions for a larger series of global changes at the height of the Cold War, including postmodernism, decolonisation, a marked increase in consumerism, the welfare state, the space race, the Non-Aligned Movement, import substitution, counterculture of the 1960s, the beginning of second-wave feminism, and a nuclear arms race.\\n \\n Timeline \\n [edit] In 2000, economist Roger Middleton wrote that economic historians generally agree that 1950 represented the beginning year of the golden age,[3] while Robert Skidelsky states 1951 is the most recognized start date.[4]\\nBoth Skidelsky and Middleton have 1973 as the generally recognized end date, though sometimes the golden age is considered to have ended as early as 1970.\\n This long-term business cycle ended with a number of events in the early 1970s:\\n the collapse of the Bretton Woods monetary system in 1971 the closing of the gold window by President Richard Nixon as a response to the Bretton Woods collapse the continued growth of international trade in manufactured goods, such as automobiles and electronics the 1973 oil crisis, the 1973–74 stock market crash, and the ensuing 1973–75 recession While this is the global period, specific countries experienced business expansions for different periods; in Taiwan, the Taiwan Miracle lasted into the late 1990s, for instance, while in France the period is referred to as Trente Glorieuses (Glorious 30 [years]) and is considered to extend for the 30-year period from 1945'),\n",

It was not until later that the world had the exceptional growth of China raising the global average. Skidelsky also reports that inequality was generally decreasing during the golden age, whereas since the Washington Consensus was formed it has been increasing.\\n Globally, the golden age was a time of unusual financial stability, with crises far less frequent and intense than before or after. Martin Wolf reports that between 1945 and 1971 (27 years) the world saw only 38 financial crises, whereas from 1973 to 1997 (24 years) there were 139.[6]\\n \\n Causes \\n [edit]  war bonds \\n Productivity \\n [edit] Agricultural productivity High productivity growth from before the war continued after the war and until the early 1970s. Manufacturing was aided by automation technologies such as feedback controllers, which appeared in the late 1930s were a fast-growing area of investment following the war. Wholesale and retail trade benefited from new highway systems, distribution warehouses, and material handling equipment such as forklifts and intermodal containers.[7][8] Oil displaced coal in many applications, particularly in locomotives and ships.[9] In agriculture, the post WWII period saw the widespread introduction of the following:\\n Chemical fertilizers Tractors Combine harvesters High-yielding variety Pesticides \\n Keynesian economics \\n [edit]  redevelopment of Norrmalm Stockholm Metro Keynesian economists argue that the post war expansion was caused by adoption of Keynesian economic policies.

It was believed that large cities would be targets in a possible war, hence the highways were designed to facilitate their evacuation and ease military maneuvers.\\n \\n Military spending \\n [edit] Another explanation for this period is the theory of the permanent war economy, which suggests that the large spending on the military helped stabilize the global economy; this has also been referred to as \"Military Keynesianism\". This also goes into hand with retired WWII vets with pensions to spend.\\n \\n Financial repression \\n [edit] This period also saw financial repression—low nominal interest rates and low or negative real interest rates (nominal rates lower than inflation plus taxation), via government policy—resulting respectively in debt servicing costs being low (low nominal rates) and in liquidation of existing debt (via inflation and taxation).[12] This allowed countries (such as the US and UK) to deal with their existing government debt level and also to reduce the level of debt without needing to direct a high portion of government spending to debt service.\\n \\n Wealth redistribution \\n [edit]  \\xa0 marginal Tax brackets \\xa0  percentile Much property was destroyed in war. In the inter-war period, the Great Depression also caused investments to lose value.[13]\\n During both World Wars, progressive taxation and capital levies were introduced, with the generally-stated aim of distributing the sacrifices required by the war more evenly. While tax rates dipped between the wars, they did not return to pre-war levels. Top tax rates increased dramatically, in some cases tenfold. This had a significant effect on both income and wealth distributions. Such policies were commonly referred to as the \"conscription of income\" and \"conscription of wealth\".[13]\\n a fundamental objection to the government\\'s policy of conscription is that it conscripts human life only, and that it does not attempt to conscript wealth...  The Economist, a British publication, opposed capital levies, but supported \"direct taxation heavy enough to amount to ration'),\n",

Price controls were also used (for instance, the price of restaurant meals was capped).[14]\\n In the post-war period, progressive taxation persisted. Inheritance taxes also had an effect. Rationing in the United Kingdom lasted until 1954. Allied war bonds matured during the post-war years, transferring cash from governments to private households.\\n In Japan, progressive tax rates were imposed during the Allied occupation, at rates that roughly matched those in the United States at that time. High marginal tax rates for the wealthiest 1% were in place throughout Japan\\'s decades of post-war growth[16] South Korea, after the Korean War saw a similar trajectory. Marginal tax rates were high on the rich, until falling quickly in the 1990s.[17] The state also legislated significant land reform, cutting deeply into a landholding elite\\'s power and clientelism.[18]\\n \\n Low oil prices \\n [edit]  oil price In the 1940s, the price of oil was about $17, rising to just over $20 during the Korean War (1951–1953). During the Vietnam War (1950s–1970s) the price of oil slowly declined to under $20. During the Arab oil embargo of 1973—the first oil shock—the price of oil rapidly rose to double in price.\\n \\n International cooperation \\n [edit]  Marshall Plan Aftermath of World War II Among the causes can be mentioned the rapid normalization of political relations between former Axis powers and the western Allies.\\nAfter the war, the major powers were determined not to repeat the mistakes of the Great Depression, some of which were ascribed to post–World War I policy errors.

The Marshall Plan for the rebuilding of Europe is most credited for reconciliation, though the immediate post-war situations was more complicated. In 1948 the Marshall Plan pumped over $12 billion to rebuild and modernize Western Europe. The European Coal and Steel Community formed the foundation of what was to become the European Union in later years.\\n \\n Institutional arrangements \\n [edit] Institutional economists point to the international institutions established in the post-war period. Structurally, the victorious Allies established the United Nations and the Bretton Woods monetary system, international institutions designed to promote stability. This was achieved through a number of policies, including promoting free trade, instituting the Marshall Plan, and the use of Keynesian economics. Although this was before modern eastern countries growing their workforce I.e. before the outsourcing problem protectionists point to.\\n \\n US Council of Economic Advisers \\n [edit] In the United States, the Employment Act of 1946 set the goals of achieving full employment, full production, and stable prices. It also created the Council of Economic Advisers to provide objective economic analysis and advice on the development and implementation of a wide range of domestic and international economic policy issues. In its first 7 years the CEA made five technical advances in policy making:[19]\\n The replacement of a \"cyclical model\" of the economy by a \"growth model,\" The setting of quantitative targets for the economy, Use of the theories of fiscal drag and full-employment budget, Recognition of the need for greater flexibility in taxation, and Replacement of the notion of unemployment as a structural problem by a realization of low aggregate demand. \\n Specific countries \\n [edit] The economies of the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, and Italy did particularly well. Japan and West Germany caught up to and exceeded the GDP of the United Kingdom during these years, even as the UK itself was experiencing the greatest absolute prosperity in its history. In France, this period is often looked back to with nostalgia as the Trente Glorieuses, or \"Glorious Thirty\", while the economies of West Germany and Austria were characterized by Wirtschaftswunder (economic miracle), and in Italy it is called Miracolo economico (economic miracle). Most developing countries also did well in this period.\\n \\n Belgium \\n [edit] Belgian economic miracle Belgium experienced a brief but very rapid economic recovery in the aftermath of World War II.

The comparatively light damage sustained by Belgium\\'s heavy industry during the German occupation and the Europe-wide need for the country\\'s traditional exports (steel and coal, textiles, and railway infrastructure) meant that Belgium became the first European country to regain its pre-war level of output in 1947. Economic growth in the period was accompanied by low inflation and sharp increases in real living standards.\\n However, lack of capital investment meant that Belgium\\'s heavy industry was ill-equipped to compete with other European industries in the 1950s. This contributed to the start of deindustrialisation in Wallonia and the emergence of regional economic disparities.\\n \\n France \\n [edit] Trente Glorieuses Between 1947 and 1973, France went through a boom period (5% growth per year on average) dubbed by Jean Fourastié Trente Glorieuses – the title of a book published in 1979. The economic growth occurred mainly due to productivity gains and to an increase in the number of working hours. Indeed, the working population grew very slowly, the \"baby boom\" being offset by the extension of the time dedicated to study. Productivity gains came from catching up with the United States. In 1950, the average income in France was 55% of that of an American; it reached 80% in 1973. Among the \"major\" nations, only Japan had faster growth in this era than France.[20]\\n The extended period of transformation and modernization also involved an increasing internationalization of the French economy. France by the 1980s had become a leading world economic power and the world\\'s fourth-largest exporter of manufactured products. It became Europe\\'s largest agricultural producer and exporter, accounting for more than 10 percent of world trade in such goods by the 1980s. The service sector grew rapidly and became the largest sector, generating a large foreign-trade surplus, chiefly from the earnings from tourism.[21]\\n \\n Italy \\n [edit] Italian economic miracle The Italian economy experienced very variable growth. In the 1950s and early 1960s the Italian economy boomed, with record high growth-rates, including 6.4% in 1959, 5.8% in 1960, 6.8% in 1961, and 6.1% in 1962. This rapid and sustained growth was due to the ambitions of several[quantify] Italian businesspeople, the opening of new industries (helped by the discovery of hydrocarbons, made for iron and steel, in the Po valley), re-'),\n",

Japan emerged as a significant power in many economic spheres, including steel working, car manufacturing and the manufacturing of electronics. Japan rapidly caught up with the West in foreign trade, GNP, and general quality of life. The high economic growth and political tranquility of the mid to late 1960s were slowed by the quadrupling of oil prices in 1973. Almost completely dependent on imports for petroleum, Japan experienced its first recession since World War\\xa0II. Another serious problem was Japan's growing trade surplus, which reached record heights. The United States pressured Japan to remedy the imbalance, demanding that Tokyo raise the value of the yen and open its markets further to facilitate more imports from the United States.[25]\\n \\n Soviet Union \\n [edit] In early 1950s, the Soviet Union, having reconstructed the ruins left by the war, experienced a decade of prosperous, undisturbed, and rapid economic growth, with significant and remarkable technological achievements most notably the first earth satellite. The nation made it to the top 15 countries with highest GDP per capita in the mid-1950s. However, the growth slowed by the mid-1960s, as the government started pouring resources into large military and space projects, and the civilian sector gradually languished. While every other major nation greatly expanded its service sector, in the Soviet Union it was given low priority.[26] Following Khrushchev's ouster, and the appointment of a collective leadership led by Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin, the economy was revitalised.[27] The economy continued to grow apace during the late 1960s, during the Eighth Five-Year Plan.[28] However, economic growth began to falter during the late 1970s,[27] beginning the Era of Stagnation.\\n \"),\n",

Sweden used to be a country of emigrants until the 1930s, but the demand for labor spurred immigration to Sweden, especially from Finland and countries like Greece, Italy and Yugoslavia.

Go round the country, go to the industrial towns, go to the farms and you will see a state of prosperity such as we have never had in my lifetime – nor indeed in the history of this country. Unemployment figures[30] show that unemployment was significantly lower during the Golden Age than before or after:\\n In addition to superior economic performance, other social indexes were higher in the golden age; for example the proportion of Britain\\'s population saying they were \"very happy\" fell from 52% in 1957 to just 36% in 2005.[31][32]\\n \\n United States \\n [edit] Economic history of the United States §\\xa0Post-World War II prosperity: 1945–1973 Economic stagnation §\\xa0End of stagnation in the U.S. after the Great Depression  The period from the end of World War II to the early 1970s was one of the greatest eras of economic expansion in world history. In the US, Gross Domestic Product increased from $228 billion in 1945 to just under $1.7 trillion in 1975. By 1975, the US economy represented some 35% of the entire world industrial output, and the US economy was over 3 times larger than that of Japan, the next largest economy.[33] The expansion was interrupted in the United States by five recessions (1948–49, 1953–54, 1957–58, 1960–61, and 1969–70).\\n $200\\xa0billion in war bonds matured, and the G.I.

The middle class swelled, as did GDP and productivity. The US underwent its own golden age of economic growth. This growth was distributed fairly evenly across the economic classes, which some attribute to the strength of labor unions in this period—labor union membership peaked during the 1950s. Much of the growth came from the movement of low-income farm workers into better-paying jobs in the towns and cities—a process largely completed by 1960.[34]\\n \\n West Germany \\n [edit] Wirtschaftswunder  Volkswagen Beetle West Germany, under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and economic minister Ludwig Erhard, saw prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s. Journalists dubbed it the Wirtschaftswunder or \"Economic Miracle\".[35] Industrial production doubled from 1950 to 1957, and gross national product grew at a rate of 9 or 10% per year, providing the engine for economic growth of all of Western Europe. Labor unions\\' support of the new policies, postponed wage increases, minimized strikes, supported technological modernization, and a policy of co-determination (Mitbestimmung), which involved a satisfactory grievance resolution system and required the representation of workers on the boards of large corporations,[36] all contributed to such a prolonged economic growth. The recovery was accelerated by the currency reform of June 1948, US gifts of $1.4 billion Marshall Plan aid, the breaking down of old trade barriers and traditional practices, and the opening of the global market.[37] West Germany gained legitimacy and respect, as it shed the horrible reputation Germany had gained under the Nazis. West Germany played a central role in the creation of European cooperation; it joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community in 1958.\\n \\n Effects \\n [edit]  youth subcultures Mods The post-war economic boom had many social, cultural, and political effects (not least of which was the demographic bulge termed the baby boom). Movements and phenomena associated with this period include the height of the Cold War, postmodernism, decolonisation, a marked increase in consumerism, the welfare state, the space race, the Non-Aligned Movement, import substitution, counterculture of the 1960s, opposition to the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, the sexual revolution, the beginning of second-wave feminism, and a nuclear arms race.

Kennedy in 1962. This optimism was symbolized through such events as the 1964 New York World\\'s Fair, and Lyndon B.

During the 1970s steel crisis, demand for steel declined, and the Western world faced competition from newly industrialized countries. This was especially harsh for mining and steel districts such as the North American Rust Belt and the West German Ruhr area.\\n \\n See also \\n [edit] Four Asian Tigers\\xa0– Economies of South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong Great acceleration\\xa0– Surge in human activity and impact upon the EarthPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets Mexican miracle\\xa0– Term for Mexico\\'s economic growth, 1954–1970 Nixon shock\\xa0– 1971 decoupling of the US dollar from gold Post-war consensus\\xa0– Period in British political history, 1945 to 1970s Spanish miracle\\xa0– Economic boom in Spain 1959-1974 \\n Notes and references \\n [edit] ^ a b .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_1904_Summer_Olympics.txt'}, page_content='\\n\\n The 1904 Summer Olympics (officially the Games of the III Olympiad and also known as St. Louis 1904) were an international multi-sport event held in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, from 1 July to 23 November 1904. Many events were conducted at what is now known as Francis Field on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis. This was the first time that the Olympic Games were held outside Europe.\\n Tensions caused by the Russo–Japanese War and difficulties in traveling to St. Louis resulted in very few top-class athletes from outside the United States and Canada taking part in the 1904 Games. Only 69–74 of the 651 athletes who competed came from outside North America, and only between 12 and 15 nations were represented in all. Some events subsequently combined the U.S. national championship with the Olympic championship.[2] The current three-medal format of gold, silver and bronze for first, second and third place was introduced at the 1904 Olympics.\\n \\n Background \\n [edit] Chicago, Illinois, initially won the bid to host the 1904 Summer Olympics,[3] but the organizers of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis would not accept another international event in the same timeframe.\\n The exposition organization began to plan for its own sports activities, informing the Chicago OCOG that its own international sports events intended to eclipse the Olympic Games unless they were moved to St. Louis. Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympic movement, then intervened and awarded the Games to St. Louis.\\n \\n The Games \\n [edit] \\n Highlights \\n [edit] Boxing, dumbbells, catch wrestling (which later became freestyle wrestling), and the decathlon made their debuts. The swimming events were held in a temporary pond near Skinker and Wydown Boulevards, where \"lifesaving demonstrations\" of unsinkable lifeboats for ocean liners took place.\\n One of the most remarkable athletes was the American gymnast George Eyser, who won six medals even though his left leg was made of wood, and Frank Kugler won four medals in freestyle wrestling, weightlifting and tug of war, making him the only competitor to win a medal in three different sports at the same Olympic Games.\\n  tug of war Chicago runner James Lightbody won the steeplechase and the 800\\xa0m and then set a natural world record in the 1500\\xa0m. Harry Hillman won both the 200\\xa0m and'),\n",

Harry Hillman won both the 200\\xa0m and 400\\xa0m hurdles and also the flat 400\\xa0m. Sprinter Archie Hahn was champion in the 60\\xa0m, 100\\xa0m and 200\\xa0m. In this last race, he set an Olympic record in 21.6, a natural record that stood for 28 years. In the discus, after American Martin Sheridan had thrown exactly the same distance as his compatriot, Ralph Rose (39.28\\xa0m), the judges gave them both an extra throw to decide the winner. Sheridan won the decider and claimed the gold medal. Ray Ewry again won all three standing jumps.[4][5]\\n The team representing Great Britain was awarded a total of two medals, both won by Irish athletes. The top non-U.S. athlete was Emil Rausch of Germany, who won three swimming events. Zoltán Halmay of Hungary and Charles Daniels of the United States each won two swimming gold medals. Galt Football Club from Canada won the gold medal in football.[4][5]\\n \\n Anthropology Days \\n [edit]  Ainu Anthropology Days The organizers of the World\\'s Fair held \"Anthropology Days\" on August 12 and 13. Since the 1889 Paris Exposition, human zoos, as a key feature of world\\'s fairs, functioned as demonstrations of anthropological notions of race, progress, and civilization. These goals were followed also at the 1904 World\\'s Fair. Fourteen hundred indigenous people from Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, East Asia, Africa, the Middle East, South America and North America were displayed in anthropological exhibits that showed them in their natural habitats. Another 1600 indigenous people displayed their culture in other areas of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (LPE), including on the fairgrounds and at the Model School, where American Indian boarding schools students demonstrated their successful assimilation.[6] The sporting event itself took place with the participation of about 100 paid indigenous men (no women participated in Anthropology Days, though some, notably the Fort Shaw Indian School girls basketball team, did compete in other athletic events at the LPE). Contests included \"baseball throwing, shot put, running, broad jumping, weight lifting, pole climbing, and tugs-of-war before a crowd of approximately ten thousand\".[7] According to theorist Susan Brownell, world\\'s fairs – with their inclusion of human zoos – and the Olympics were a logical fit at this time'),\n",

In July 2021, the IOC accepted the recommendations of Olympic historian Bill Mallon, and adjusted their database with regard to the following cases:\\n In 2009, historians from the International Society of Olympic Historians discovered that cyclist Frank Bizzoni, believed to be an American, was still an Italian citizen when he competed in 1904: he received U.S. citizenship in 1917.[33] Two Norwegian-American wrestlers, Charles Ericksen and Bernhoff Hansen won gold medals. In 2012, Norwegian historians found documentation showing that Ericksen did not receive American citizenship until March 22, 1905, while Hansen probably never received American citizenship. The historians therefore petitioned the IOC to have the athletes registered as Norwegians.[34][35] In May 2013, it was reported that the Norwegian Olympic Committee had filed a formal application for changing the nationality of the wrestlers in the IOC's medal database,[36] which was done. Swimmer and multi-medalist Francis Gailey competed in 1904 as an Australian. He immigrated to America in 1906, sailing to San Francisco on the SS Sonoma, and worked as a banker in California, living for a time in Ontario, Canada, where he married Mary Adams, and finally settled in southern California in 1918, managing orange-grove plantations.[37] Multi-medalist Frank Kugler of Germany, a member of the St. Louis Southwest Turnverein team, was granted U.S. citizenship in 1913.[38] Gustav Tiefenthaler was born in Switzerland, but the family moved to the United States when he was a child: he represented the South Broadway AC in St. Louis. At the Olympics, Tiefenthaler wrestled one bout and lost, but earned a bronze medal.[39] French-American Albert Corey won silver medals in the marathon, and in the team race as part of a mixed team (together with four undisputed Americans).[40] Austrian-American gymnast Julius Lenhart won gold and silver medals in individual events and gold medal in team competition as a part of the mixed team. The IOC also counted one gold, one silver, and two bronze medals won by the American fencer Albertson Van Zo Post for Cuba instead of the United States: the IOC also showed Charles Tatham as Cuban for individual fencing events and American for the team event, but he was an American.[41]\\n \\n See also \\n [edit] Olympic Games portal Olympic Games held in the United States\\n1904 Summer Olympics – St\"),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Aerospace.txt'}, page_content='Airspace The Aerospace Corporation  Aerospace is a term used to collectively refer to the atmosphere and outer space. Aerospace activity is very diverse, with a multitude of commercial, industrial, and military applications. Aerospace engineering consists of aeronautics and astronautics. Aerospace organizations research, design, manufacture, operate, maintain, and repair both aircraft and spacecraft.[1]\\n The beginning of space and the ending of the air are proposed as 100km (62mi) above the ground according to the physical explanation that the air density is too low for a lifting body to generate meaningful lift force without exceeding orbital velocity.[2]\\n \\n Overview \\n [edit] In most industrial countries, the aerospace industry is a cooperation of the public and private sectors. For example, several states have a civilian space program funded by the government, such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the United States, European Space Agency in Europe, the Canadian Space Agency in Canada, Indian Space Research Organisation in India, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency in Japan, Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities in Russia, China National Space Administration in China, SUPARCO in Pakistan, Iranian Space Agency in Iran, and Korea Aerospace Research Institute in South Korea.\\n Along with these public space programs, many companies produce technical tools and components such as spacecraft and satellites. Some known companies involved in space programs include Boeing, Cobham, Airbus, SpaceX, Lockheed Martin, United Technologies, MDA and Northrop Grumman. These companies are also involved in other areas of aerospace, such as the construction of aircraft.\\n \\n History \\n [edit] History of aviation Timeline of space exploration  Modern aerospace began with Engineer George Cayley in 1799. Cayley proposed an aircraft with a \"fixed wing and a horizontal and vertical tail,\" defining characteristics of the modern aeroplane.[3]\\n The 19th century saw the creation of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain (1866), the American Rocketry Society, and the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences, all of which made aeronautics a more serious scientific discipline.[3] Airmen like Otto Lilienthal, who introduced cambered airfoils in 1891, used gliders to analyze aerodynamic forces.[3] The Wright brothers were interested in Lilienthal\\'s work and read several of his publications.[3] They also found inspiration in Octave Chanute, an airman and the author of Progress in Flying Machines (1894).[3] It was the preliminary work of Cay'),\n",

World War II inspired Wernher von Braun to create the V1 and V2 rockets.\\n The launch of Sputnik 1 in October 1957 started the Space Age, and on July 20, 1969 Apollo 11 achieved the first crewed Moon landing.[3] In April 1981, the Space Shuttle Columbia launched, the start of regular crewed access to orbital space. A sustained human presence in orbital space started with \"Mir\" in 1986 and is continued by the \"International Space Station\".[3] Space commercialization and space tourism are more recent features of aerospace.\\n \\n Manufacturing \\n [edit] Aerospace manufacturer  Aerospace manufacturing is a high-technology industry that produces \"aircraft, guided missiles, space vehicles, aircraft engines, propulsion units, and related parts\".[4] Most of the industry is geared toward governmental work.  For each original equipment manufacturer (OEM), the US government has assigned a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code. These codes help to identify each manufacturer, repair facilities, and other critical aftermarket vendors in the aerospace industry.\\n In the United States, the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are the two largest consumers of aerospace technology and products. Others include the very large airline industry. The aerospace industry employed 472,000 wage and salary workers in 2006.[5] Most of those jobs were in Washington state and in California, with Missouri, New York and Texas also being important. The leading aerospace manufacturers in the U.S. are Boeing, United Technologies Corporation, SpaceX, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. As talented American employees age and retire, these manufacturers face an expanding labor shortfall. In order to supply the industrial sector with fresh workers, apprenticeship programs like the Aerospace Joint Apprenticeship Council (AJAC) collaborate with community colleges and aerospace firms in Washington state.\\n Important locations of the civilian aerospace industry worldwide include Washington state (Boeing), California (Boeing, Lockheed Martin, etc.) and Montreal, Quebec, Canada (Bombardier, Pratt & Whitney Canada)'),\n",

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched India's first Moon orbiter, Chandrayaan-1, in October 2008.\\n In Russia, large aerospace companies like Oboronprom and the United Aircraft Building Corporation (encompassing Mikoyan, Sukhoi, Ilyushin, Tupolev, Yakovlev, and Irkut which includes Beriev) are among the major global players in this industry. The historic Soviet Union was also the home of a major aerospace industry.\\n The United Kingdom formerly attempted to maintain its own large aerospace industry, making its own airliners and warplanes, but it has largely turned its lot over to cooperative efforts with continental companies, and it has turned into a large import customer, too, from countries such as the United States. However, the UK has a very active aerospace sector, with major companies such as BAE Systems, supplying fully assembled aircraft, aircraft components, sub-assemblies and sub-systems to other manufacturers, both in Europe and all over the world.\\n Canada has formerly manufactured some of its own designs for jet warplanes, etc. (e.g. the CF-100 fighter), but for some decades, it has relied on imports from the United States and Europe to fill these needs. However Canada still manufactures some military aircraft although they are generally not combat capable. Another notable example was the late 1950s development of the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow, a supersonic fighter-interceptor whose 1959 cancellation was considered highly controversial.\\n France has continued to make its own warplanes\"),\n",

(See Saab AB.) Other European countries either team up in making fighters (such as the Panavia Tornado and the Eurofighter Typhoon), or else to import them from the United States.\\n Pakistan has a developing aerospace engineering industry. The National Engineering and Scientific Commission, Khan Research Laboratories and Pakistan Aeronautical Complex are among the premier organizations involved in research and development in this sector. Pakistan has the capability of designing and manufacturing guided rockets, missiles and space vehicles. The city of Kamra is home to the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex which contains several factories. This facility is responsible for manufacturing the MFI-17, MFI-395, K-8 and JF-17 Thunder aircraft. Pakistan also has the capability to design and manufacture both armed and unarmed unmanned aerial vehicles.\\n In the People\\'s Republic of China, Beijing, Xi\\'an, Chengdu, Shanghai, Shenyang and Nanchang are major research and manufacture centers of the aerospace industry. China has developed an extensive capability to design, test and produce military aircraft, missiles and space vehicles. Despite the cancellation in 1983 of the experimental Shanghai Y-10, China is still developing its civil aerospace industry.\\n The aircraft parts industry was born out of the sale of second-hand or used aircraft parts from the aerospace manufacture sector.  Within the United States there is a specific process that parts brokers or resellers must follow.  This includes leveraging a certified repair station to overhaul and \"tag\" a part.  This certification guarantees that a part was repaired or overhauled to meet OEM specifications.  Once a part is overhauled its value is determined from the supply and demand of the aerospace market.  When an airline has an aircraft on the ground, the part that the airline requires to get the plane back into service becomes invaluable.  This can drive the market for specific parts.  There are several online marketplaces that assist with the commodity selling of aircraft parts.\\n In the aerospace and defense industry, much consolidation has occurred at the end of the 20th century, going into the 21st century. Between 1988 and 2011, more than 6,068 mergers & acquisitions with a total known value of US$678 billion have been announced worldwide.[6] The largest transactions have been:\\n The acquisition of'),\n",

To improve low-speed performance, a de Havilland DH4 was modified by Handley Page to a monoplane with high-lift devices: full-span leading-edge slats and trailing-edge flaps; in 1924, Fowler flaps that extend backward and downward were invented in the US, and used on the Lockheed Model 10 Electra while in 1943 forward-hinged leading-edge Krueger flaps were invented in Germany and later used on the Boeing 707. The 1927 large Propeller Research Tunnel at NACA Langley confirmed that the landing gear was a major source of drag, in 1930 the Boeing Monomail featured a retractable gear. The flush rivet displaced the domed rivet in the 1930s and pneumatic rivet guns work in combination with a heavy reaction bucking bar; not depending on plastic deformation, specialist rivets were developed to improve fatigue life as shear fasteners like the Hi-Lok, threaded pins tightened until a collar breaks off with enough torque. First flown in 1935, the Queen Bee was a radio-controlled target drone derived from the Tiger Moth for Flak training; the Ryan Firebee was a jet-powered target drone developed into long-range reconnaissance UAVs: the Ryan Model 147 Fire Fly and Lightning Bug; the Israeli IAI Scout and Tadiran'),\n",

At the end of World War I, piston engine power could be boosted by compressing intake air with a compressor, also compensating for decreasing air density with altitude, improved with 1930s turbochargers for the Boeing B-17  and the first pressurized airliners. The 1937 Hindenburg disaster ended the era of passenger airships but the US Navy used airships for anti-submarine warfare and airborne early warning into the 1960s, while small airships continue to be used for aerial advertising, sightseeing flights, surveillance and research, and the Airlander 10 or the Lockheed Martin LMH-1 continue to be developed. As US airlines were interested in high-altitude flying in the mid-1930s, the Lockheed XC-35 with a pressurized cabin was tested in 1937 and the Boeing 307 Stratoliner would be the  first pressurized airliner to enter commercial service. In 1933, Plexiglas, a transparent Acrylic plastic, was introduced in Germany and shortly before World War II, was first used for aircraft windshields as it is lighter than glass, and the bubble canopy improved fighter pilots visibility. In January 1930, Royal Air Force pilot and engineer Frank Whittle filed a patent for a gas turbine aircraft engine with an inlet, compressor, combustor, turbine and nozzle, while an independent turbojet was developed by researcher Hans von Ohain in Germany; both engines ran within weeks in early 1937 and the Heinkel HeS 3-propelled Heinkel He 178 experimental aircraft made its first flight on Aug 27, 1939 while the Whittle W.1-powered Gloster E.28/39 prototype flew on May 15, 1941. In 1935, Britain demonstrated aircraft radio detection and ranging and in 1940 the RAF introduced the first VHF airborne radars on Bristol Blenheims, then higher-resolution microwave-frequency radar with a cavity magnetron on Bristol Beaufighters in 1941, and in 1959 the radar-homing Hughes AIM-4 Falcon became the first US guided missile on the Convair F-106.

The modern ejection seat was developed during World War II, a seat on rails ejected by rockets before deploying a parachute, which could have been enhanced by the USAF in the late 1960s as a turbojet-powered autogyro with 50\\xa0nm of range, the Kaman KSA-100 SAVER. In 1942, numerical control machining was conceived by machinist John T. Parsons to cut complex structures from solid blocks of alloy, rather than assembling them, improving quality, reducing weight, and saving time and cost to produce bulkheads or wing skins. In World War II, the German V-2 combined gyroscopes, an accelerometer and a primitive computer for real-time inertial navigation allowing dead reckoning without reference to landmarks or guide stars, leading to packaged IMUs for spacecraft and aircraft. The UK Miles M.52 supersonic aircraft was to have an afterburner, augmenting a turbojet thrust by burning additional fuel in the nozzle, but was cancelled in 1946. In 1935, German aerodynamicist Adolf Busemann proposed using swept wings to reduce high-speed drag and the Messerschmitt P.1101 fighter prototype was 80% complete by the end of World War II; the later US North American F-86 and Boeing B-47 flew in 1947, as the Soviet MiG-15, and the British de Havilland Comet in 1949. In 1951, the Avro Jetliner featured an ice protection system from Goodyear through electro-thermal resistances in the wing and tail leading edges; jet aircraft use hot engine bleed air and lighter aircraft use pneumatic deicing boots or weep anti-icing fluid on propellers, wing and tail leading edges. In 1954, Bell Labs developed the first transistorized airborne digital computer, Tradic for the US Boeing B-52 and in the 1960s Raytheon built the MIT-developed Apollo Guidance Computer; the MIL-STD-1553 avionics digital bus was defined in 1973 then first used in the General Dynamics F-16, while the civil ARINC 429 was first used in the Boeing 757/B767 and Airbus A310 in the early 1980s.

After World War II, the initial promoter of Photovoltaic power for spacecraft, Hans K. Ziegler, was brought to the US under Operation Paperclip along Wernher von Braun and Vanguard 1 was its first application in 1958, later enhanced in space-deployable structures like the International Space Station solar arrays of 0.33 hectares (0.82 acres). To board an airliner, jet bridges  are more accessible, comfortable and efficient than climbing the stairs. In the 1950s, to improve thrust and fuel efficiency, the jet engine airflow was divided into a core stream and a bypass stream with a lower velocity for better propulsive efficiency: the first was the Rolls-Royce Conway with a 0.3 BPR on the Boeing 707 in 1960, followed by the Pratt & Whitney JT3D with a 1.5 BPR and, derived from the J79, the General Electric CJ805 powered the Convair 990 with a 28%  lower cruise fuel burn; bypass ratio improved to the 9.3 BPR Rolls-Royce Trent XWB, the 10:1 BPR GE9X and the Pratt & Whitney GTF with high-pressure ratio cores. \\n Functional safety \\n [edit] AS9100 Functional safety relates to a part of the general safety of a system or a piece of equipment. It implies that the system or equipment can be operated properly and without causing any danger, risk, damage or injury.\\n Functional safety is crucial in the aerospace industry, which allows no compromises or negligence. In this respect, supervisory bodies, such as the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA),[12] regulate the aerospace market with strict certification standards. This is meant to reach and ensure the highest possible level of safety. The standards AS 9100 in America, EN 9100 on the European market or JISQ 9100 in Asia particularly address the aerospace and aviation industry. These are standards applying to the functional safety of aerospace vehicles. Some companies are therefore specialized in the certification, inspection verification and testing of the vehicles and spare parts to ensure and attest compliance with the appropriate regulations.\\n \\n Spinoffs \\n [edit] Spinoffs refer to any technology that is a direct result of coding or products created by NASA and redesigned for an alternate purpose.[13] These technological advancements are one of the primary results of the aerospace industry, with $5.2 billion worth of revenue generated by spinoff technology, including computers and cellular'),\n",

Affiliated with the labor movement,[2][3][4] the EPI is usually described as presenting a left-leaning and pro-union viewpoint on public policy issues.[5][6] Since 2021, EPI has been led by economist Heidi Shierholz, the former chief economist of the Department of Labor.\\n EPI has an advocacy arm, EPI Action, which is a 501(c)(4) group.\\n \\n History \\n [edit] EPI was founded in 1986 by economists Jeff Faux, Lester Thurow, Ray Marshall, Barry Bluestone, Robert Reich, and Robert Kuttner.[7] Since 2021, Heidi Shierholz has served as its president.[8] Shierholz succeeded Thea Lee, who was named Deputy Undersecretary for International Affairs at the Department of Labor by President Joe Biden.[9]  \\n \\n Policy proposals \\n [edit] EPI supported Bernie Sanders's Medicare for All proposal. In a March 2020 policy paper, it argued that the loss of jobs in the insurance industry and in administering the current system would be small, within the normal job churn, and easily absorbed by the economy. The paper argued that this cost would be outweighed by the benefits of universal health care and in small business formation.[10][11] EPI has also released policy papers analyzing U.S. investment in early childhood education.[12]\\n In July 2012, EPI\"),\n",

The Prosperity Economics plan suggests that major public investment in areas like infrastructure is needed to jump-start the economy.[13]\\n  Heidi Shierholz United States Department of Labor In response to the debate over the United States fiscal cliff, EPI economist Josh Bivens advocated raising tax rates for higher income earners, writing: \"Given this rise in [income] inequality, it makes sense that much of the future burden of reducing budget deficits should be borne by those who have benefited the most from economic trends in recent decades.\"[14]\\n \\n Funding \\n [edit] Eight labor unions made a five-year funding pledge to EPI at its inception: AFSCME, United Auto Workers, United Steelworkers, United Mine Workers, International Association of Machinists, Communications Workers of America, Service Employees International Union, and United Food and Commercial Workers Union.[15] According to EPI, about 29% of its funding between 2005 and 2009 was supplied by labor unions and about 53% came from foundation grants.[7]\\n In the 1980s, EPI took money from the Tobacco Institute, a now-defunct tobacco industry trade group, to oppose excise taxes on the tobacco industry\\'s behalf. The Tobacco Institute worked with groups like EPI \"to support the release of studies, editorials, press briefings, and testimony against regressive excise taxes\" that would negatively impact the tobacco industry\\'s bottom line if passed.[16]\\n \\n References \\n [edit] ^ a b .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9'),\n",

State governments set overall educational standards, often mandate standardized tests for K–12 public school systems and supervise, usually through a board of regents, state colleges, and universities. The bulk of the $1.3 trillion in funding comes from state and local governments, with federal funding accounting for about $260 billion in 2021[9] compared to around $200 billion in past years.[2]\\n Private schools are free to determine their own curriculum and staffing policies, with voluntary accreditation available through independent regional accreditation authorities, although some state regulation can apply.\\n As of 2013, about 87% of school-age children attended state-funded public schools, about 10% attended tuition and foundation-funded private schools,[10] and roughly 3% were home-schooled.[11]\\n Total expenditures for American public elementary and secondary schools amounted to $927 billion in 2020–21 (in constant 2021–22 dollars).[12]\\n By state law, education is compulsory over an age range starting between five and eight and ending somewhere between ages sixteen and nineteen, depending on the state.[13] This requirement can be satisfied in public or state-certified private schools, or an approved home school program. Compulsory education is divided into three levels: elementary school, middle or junior high school, and high school.\\n Numerous publicly and privately administered colleges and universities offer a wide variety of post-secondary education. Post-secondary education is divided into college, as the first tertiary degree, and graduate school. Higher education includes public research universities, private liberal arts colleges, historically black colleges and universities, community colleges, for-profit colleges, and many other kinds and combinations of institutions. College enrollment rates in the United States have increased over the long term.[14] At the same time, student loan debt has also risen to $1.5 trillion.\\n The large majority of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25, and the most prestigious – Harvard University.[15][16][17][18] The country placed first in the annual U.S. News & World Report Best Countries for Education rankings.[17] The U.S. has by far the\"),\n",

The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of American 15-year-olds as 19th in the world in reading literacy, mathematics, and science with the average American student scoring 495, compared with the OECD Average of 488.[30][31] In 2017, 46.4% of Americans aged 25 to 64 attained some form of post-secondary education.[5] 48% of Americans aged 25 to 34 attained some form of tertiary education, about 4% above the OECD average of 44%.[32][33][34] 35% of Americans aged 25 and over have achieved a bachelor's degree or higher.[35]\\n \\n History \\n [edit] History of education in the United States \\n 19th century \\n [edit] New England encouraged its towns to support free public schools funded by taxation. In the early 19th century, Massachusetts took the lead in education reform and public education with programs designed by Horace Mann that were widely emulated across the North. Teachers were specially trained in normal schools and taught the three Rs (reading, writing, and arithmetic) and also history and geography. Public education was at the elementary level in most places.\\n After the Civil War end in 1865, cities began building high schools. The South was far behind northern standards on every educational measure and gave weak support to its segregated all-black schools. However, northern philanthropy and northern churches provided assistance to private black colleges across the South. Religious denominations across the country set up their private colleges. States also opened state universities, but they were quite small until well into the 20th century.\\n In 1823, Samuel Read Hall founded the first normal school, the Columbian School in Concord, Vermont,[36][37] aimed at improving the quality of the burgeoning common school system by producing more qualified teachers.\\n During Reconstruction, the United States Office of Education was created in an attempt to standardize educational reform across the country. At the outset, the goals of the Office were to track statistical data on schools and provide insight into the educational outcomes of schools in each state. While supportive of educational improvement, the office lacked the power to enforce policies in any state. Educational aims across the states\"),\n",

Educational aims across the states in the nineteenth century were broad, making it difficult to create shared goals and priorities. States like Massachusetts, with long-established educational institutions, had well-developed priorities in place by the time the Office of Education was established. In the South and the West, however, newly formed common school systems had different needs and priorities.[38] Competing interests among state legislators limited the ability of the Office of Education to enact change.\\n In the mid-19th century, the rapidly increasing Catholic population led to the formation of parochial schools in the largest cities. Theologically oriented Episcopalian, Lutheran, and Jewish bodies on a smaller scale set up their own parochial schools. There were debates over whether tax money could be used to support them, with the answer typically being no. From about 1876, thirty-nine states passed a constitutional amendment to their state constitutions, called Blaine Amendment after James G. Blaine, one of their chief promoters, forbidding the use of public tax money to fund local parochial schools.\\n States passed laws to make schooling compulsory between 1852 (Massachusetts) and 1917 (Mississippi). They also used federal funding designated by the Morrill Land-Grant Acts of 1862 and 1890 to set up land grant colleges specializing in agriculture and engineering. By 1870, every state had free elementary schools,[39] albeit only in urban centers. According to a 2018 study in the Economic Journal, states were more likely to adopt compulsory education laws during the Age of Mass Migration (1850–1914) if they hosted more European immigrants with lower exposure to civic values.[40]\\n Following Reconstruction the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute was founded in 1881 as a state college, in Tuskegee, Alabama, to train \"Colored Teachers,\" led by Booker T. Washington, (1856–1915), who was himself a freed slave. His movement spread, leading many other Southern states to establish small colleges for \"Colored or Negro\" students entitled \"A. & M.\" (\"Agricultural and Mechanical\") or \"A. & T.\" (\"Agricultural and Technical\"), some of which later developed into state universities. Before the 1940s, there were very few black students at private or state colleges in the North and almost none in the South.[41]\\n Responding to the many competing academic philosophies being promoted at the time, an influential working group of educators'),\n",

Between 1910 and 1940 the high school movement resulted in a rapid increase in public high school enrollment and graduations.[42] By 1930, 100% of children were attending school, excluding children with significant disabilities or medical concerns.[42]\\n Private schools spread during this time, as well as colleges and, in the rural centers, land grant colleges.[42] In 1922, an attempt was made by the voters of Oregon to enact the Oregon Compulsory Education Act, which would require all children between the ages of 8 and 16 to attend public schools, only leaving exceptions for mentally or physically unfit children, exceeding a certain living distance from a public school, or having written consent from a county superintendent to receive private instruction. The law was passed by popular vote but was later ruled unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, determining that \"a child is not a mere creature of the state\". This case settled the dispute about whether or not private schools had the right to do business and educate within the United States.[43]\\n By 1938, there was a movement to bring education to six years of elementary school, four years of junior high school, and four years of high school.[44]\\n During World War II, enrollment in high schools and colleges plummeted as many high school and college students and teachers dropped out to enlist or take war-related jobs.[45][46][47]\\n The 1946 National School Lunch Act provided low-cost or free school lunch meals to qualified low-income students through subsidies to schools based on the idea that a \"full stomach\" during the day supports class attention and studying.\\n The 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v.

Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas made racial desegregation of public elementary and high schools mandatory, although white families often attempted to avoid desegregation by sending their children to private secular or religious schools.[48][49][50] In the years following this decision, the number of Black teachers rose in the North but dropped in the South.[51]\\n In 1965, the far-reaching Elementary and Secondary Education Act (\\'ESEA\\'), passed as a part of President Lyndon B. Johnson\\'s War on poverty, provided funds for primary and secondary education (\\'Title I funding\\'). Title VI explicitly forbade the establishment of a national curriculum.[52] Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 created the Pell Grant program which provides financial support to students from low-income families to access higher education.\\n In 1975, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act established funding for special education in schools.\\n The Higher Education Amendments of 1972 made changes to the Pell Grant. The 1975 Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHA) required all public schools accepting federal funds to provide equal access to education and one free meal a day for children with physical and mental disabilities. The 1983 National Commission on Excellence in Education report, famously titled A Nation at Risk, touched off a wave of federal, state, and local reform efforts, but by 1990 the country still spent only 2% of its budget on education, compared with 30% on support for the elderly.[53] In 1990, the EHA was replaced with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which placed more focus on students as individuals, and also provided for more post-high school transition services.\\n \\n 21st century \\n [edit] The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, passed by a bipartisan coalition in Congress, provided federal aid to the states in exchange for measures to penalize schools that were not meeting the goals as measured by standardized state exams in mathematics and language skills. This made standardized testing a requirement.[54][55][56] In the same year, the U.S. Supreme Court diluted some of the century-old \"Blaine\" laws upheld an Ohio law allowing aid to parochial schools under specific circumstances.[57] The 2006 Commission on the Future of Higher Education evaluated higher education.

The response included cuts to education budgets. Obama's $800 billion stimulus package of 2009 included $100 billion for public schools, which every state used to protect its education budget. In terms of sponsoring innovation; however, then-President Obama and then-Education Secretary Arne Duncan pursued K-12 education reform through the Race to the Top grant program. With over $15 billion of grants at stake, 34 states quickly revised their education laws according to the proposals of advanced educational reformers. In the competition, points were awarded for allowing charter schools to multiply, for compensating teachers on a merit basis including student test scores, and for adopting higher educational standards.\\n There were incentives for states to establish college and career-ready standards, which in practice meant adopting the Common Core State Standards Initiative that had been developed on a bipartisan basis by the National Governors Association, and the Council of Chief State School Officers. The criteria were not mandatory, they were incentives to improve opportunities to get a grant. Most states revised their laws accordingly, even though they realized it was unlikely they would win a highly competitive new grant. Race to the Top had strong bipartisan support, with centrist elements from both parties. It was opposed by the left wing of the Democratic Party, and by the right wing of the Republican Party, and criticized for centralizing too much power in Washington. Complaints also came from middle-class families, who were annoyed at the increasing emphasis on teaching to the test, rather than encouraging teachers to show creativity and stimulating students' imagination.[59][60] Voters in both major parties have been critical of the Common Core initiative.[61]\\n During the 2010s, American student loan debt became recognized as a social problem.[62][63][64][65][66]\\n Like every wealthy country, the COVID-19 pandemic and Deltacron hybrid variant had a great impact on education in the United States, requiring schools to implement technology and transition to virtual meetings.[67][68] Although the use of technology improves the grading process and the quality of information received,[69] critics assess it a poor substitute for in-person learning, and that online-only education disadvantages students without internet access, who disproportionately live in poor households, and that technology may make it harder for students to pay attention.[70][71]\\n Some colleges and universities became vulnerable to permanent\"),\n",

Universities and colleges were refunding tuition monies to students while investing in online technology and tools, making it harder to invest into empty campuses. Schools are defined as being in low financial health if their combined revenue and unrestricted assets will no longer cover operating expenses in six years. Before COVID-19, 13 institutions were in danger of closing within 6 years in New England.[72] With the presence of COVID-19, that number has increased to 25 institutions.[72] In the United States due to the financial impact caused by COVID-19, 110 more colleges and universities are now at risk of closing. This labels the total number of colleges and universities in peril due to pandemic to be 345 institutions.[72] While prestigious colleges and universities have historically had financial cushion due to high levels of enrollment, private colleges at a low risk have dropped from 485 to 385.[72] Federal COVID-19 relief has assisted students and universities. However, it has not been enough to bandage the financial wound created by COVID-19. Colby-Sawyer College located in New Hampshire has received about $780,000 in assistance through the United States Department of Education.[72] About half of this money was dispersed amongst the student body. Colby-Swayer College was also capable of receiving a loan of $2.65 million, to avoid layoffs of their 312 employees.[72]\\n Yale economist Fabrizio Zilibotti co-authored a January 2022 study with professors from the Columbia University, New York University, University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, Northwestern University, and the University of Amsterdam, showing that \"the pandemic is widening educational inequality and that the learning gaps created by the crisis will persist.\"[71][73] As of result, COVID-19 educational impact in the United States has ended by March 11, 2022, as Deltacron cases fall and ahead of the living with an endemic phase.[citation needed]\\n \\n Statistics \\n [edit]  [74] \\nIn 2000, 76.6 million students had enrolled in schools from kindergarten through graduate schools.

The average salary for college or university graduates is greater than $51,000, exceeding the national average of those without a high school diploma by more than $23,000, according to a 2005 study by the U.S. Census Bureau.[76]\\n The 2010 unemployment rate for high school graduates was 10.8%; the rate for college graduates was 4.9%.[77]\\n The country has a reading literacy rate of 99% of the population over age 15,[78] while ranking below average in science and mathematics understanding compared to other developed countries.[79] In 2014, a record high of 82% of high school seniors graduated, although one of the reasons for that success might be a decline in academic standards.[80]\\n The poor performance has pushed public and private efforts such as the No Child Left Behind Act. In addition, the ratio of college-educated adults entering the workforce to the general population (33%) is slightly below the mean of other[which?] developed countries (35%)[81] and rate of participation of the labor force in continuing education is high.[82] A 2000s (decade) study by Jon Miller of Michigan State University concluded that \"A slightly higher proportion of American adults qualify as scientifically literate than European or Japanese adults\".[83]\\n In 2006, there were roughly 600,000 homeless students in the United States, but after the Great Recession this number more than doubled to approximately 1.36 million.[84] The Institute for Child Poverty and Homelessness keeps track of state by state levels of child homelessness.[85] As of 2017[update], 27% of U.S. students live in a mother-only household, 20% live in poverty, and 9% are non-English speaking.[86]\\n An additional factor in the United States education system is the socioeconomic background of the students being tested. According to the National Center for Children in Poverty, 41% of U.S. children under the age of 18 come from lower-income families.[87] These students require specialized attention to perform well in school and on the standardized tests.[87]\\n The Human Rights Measurement Initiative[88] finds that the United States is achieving 77.8% of what should be possible on the right to education at its level of income.[89]\\n Result'),\n",

During the 2019–2020 school year, enrollment rates decreased by 6% for those aged five, dropping from 91% to 84%, and by 13% for those aged three and four, from 54% to 40%.[4]\\n Summer 2022 polls and surveys revealed that mental health issues were reported by 60% of college students, with educational institutions being understaffed and unprepared to effectively address the crisis.[93]\\n A five-year, $14 million study of U.S. adult literacy involving lengthy interviews of U.S. adults, the most comprehensive study of literacy ever commissioned by the U.S. government,[94] was released in September 1993. It involved lengthy interviews of over 26,700 adults statistically balanced for age, gender, ethnicity, education level, and location (urban, suburban, or rural) in 12 states across the U.S. and was designed to represent the U.S. population as a whole. This government study showed that 21% to 23% of adult Americans were not \"able to locate information in text\", could not \"make low-level inferences using printed materials\", and were unable to \"integrate easily identifiable pieces of information\".[94]\\n The U.S. Department of Education\\'s 2003 statistics indicated that 14% of the population—or 32 million adults—had very low literacy skills.[95] Statistics were similar in 2013.[96] In 2015, only 37% of students were able to read at a proficient level, a level which has barely changed since the 1990s.[97]\\n \\n Attainment \\n [edit] Educational attainment in the United States In the 21st century, the educational attainment of the U.S. population is similar to that of many other industrialized countries with the vast majority of the population having completed secondary education and a rising number of college graduates that'),\n",

As a whole, the population of the United States is becoming increasingly more educated.[74]\\n Post-secondary education is valued very highly by American society and is one of the main determinants of class and status.[citation needed] As with income, however, there are significant discrepancies in terms of race, age, household configuration and geography.[98]\\n Since the 1980s, the number of educated Americans has continued to grow, but at a slower rate. Some have attributed this to an increase in the foreign-born portion of the workforce. However, the decreasing growth of the educational workforce has instead been primarily due to the slowing down in educational attainment of people schooled in the United States.[99]\\n \\n Remedial education in college \\n [edit] Despite high school graduates formally qualifying for college, only 4% of two-year and four-year colleges do not have any students in noncredit remedial courses. Over 200 colleges place most of their first-year students in one or more remedial courses. Almost 40% of students in remedial courses fail to complete them. The cause cannot be excessively demanding college courses, since grade inflation has made those courses increasingly easy in recent decades.[100][101]\\n \\n Sex differences \\n [edit] Sex differences in education in the United States  Algebra I [102] According to research over the past 20 years, girls generally outperform boys in the classroom on measures of grades across all subjects and graduation rates.

Reading scores could not be reported due to printing errors in the instructions of the U.S. test booklets. U.S. scores were behind those of most other developed nations.[105]\\n  In 2007, Americans stood second only to Canadians in the percentage of 35 to 64-year-olds holding at least two-year degrees.

A significant number of teachers have to work extra hours or other jobs to make up for low pay, with nearly 17% of teachers having a job outside the school system in 2020–21. Public school teachers also work more than the required 39.4 hours a week, with an average of 52 hours worked per week, only 25.2 of which is spent on teaching. Additionally, teachers earn lower weekly wages and receive lower overall compensation for their work than similar college-educated peers, a phenomenon known as the \"pay penalty.\"[112] Federal legislation proposed in December 2022 and endorsed February 2023 by Senate Finance Committee chair Bernie Sanders would set a minimum salary of $60,000 per year for teachers.[112][113]\\n \\n Educational stages \\n [edit]  Formal education in the U.S. is divided into a number of distinct educational stages. Most children enter the public education system around the ages of five or six. Children are assigned into year groups known as grades.\\n The American school year traditionally begins at the end of August or early in September, after a traditional summer vacation or break. Children customarily advance together from one grade to the next as a single cohort or \"class\" upon reaching the end of each school year in late May or early June.\\n Depending upon their circumstances, children may begin school in pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, or first grade. Students normally attend 12 grades of study over 12 calendar years of primary/elementary and secondary education before graduating and earning a diploma that makes them eligible for admission to higher education. Education is mandatory until age 16 (18 in some states).\\n In the U.S., ordinal numbers (e.g., first grade) are used for identifying grades. Typical ages and grade groupings in contemporary, public, and private schools may be found through the U.S. Department of Education. Generally, there are three stages: elementary school (grades K/1–2/3/4/5/6), intermediate school (3/4–5/6), middle'),\n",

Note that many people may not choose to attain higher education immediately after high school graduation, so the age of completing each level of education may vary. The table below shows the traditional education path of a student completing an undergraduate degree immediately after high school.\\n In K–12 education, sometimes students who receive failing grades are held back a year and repeat coursework in the hope of earning satisfactory scores on the second try.\\n High school graduates sometimes take one or more gap years before the first year of college, for travel, work, public service, or independent learning. Some might opt for a postgraduate year before college.[115] Many high schoolers also earn an associate degree when they graduate high school.[116]\\n Many undergraduate college programs now commonly are five-year programs. This is especially common in technical fields, such as engineering. The five-year period often includes one or more periods of internship with an employer in the chosen field.\\n Of students who were freshmen in 2005 seeking bachelor's degrees at public institutions, 32% took four years, 12% took five years, 6% took six years, and 43% did not graduate within six years. The numbers for private non-profit institutions were 52% in four, 10% in five, 4% in six, and 35% failing to graduate.[117]\\n Some undergraduate institutions offer an accelerated three-year bachelor's degree, or a combined five-year bachelor's and master's degrees. Many times, these accelerated degrees are offered online or as evening courses and are targeted mainly but not always for adult learners/nontraditional students.\\n Many graduate students do not start professional schools immediately after finishing undergraduate studies but work for a time while saving up money or deciding on a career direction.\\n The National Center for Education Statistics found that in 1999–2000, 73% of undergraduates had characteristics of nontraditional students.[118]\\n \\n Early childhood education \\n [edit] Early childhood education in the United States Early childhood teaching in the U.S. relates to the teaching of children (formally and informally) from birth up to the age of eight.[119] The education services are delivered via preschools and\"),\n",

The Head Start program is a federally funded early childhood education program for low-income children and their families founded in 1965 that prepares children, especially those of a disadvantaged population, to better succeed in school. However, limited seats are available to students aspiring to take part in the Head Start program. Many community-based programs, commercial enterprises, non-profit organizations, faith communities, and independent childcare providers offer preschool education. Preschool may be general or may have a particular focus, such as arts education, religious education, sports training, or foreign language learning, along with providing general education.[citation needed] In the United States, Preschool programs are not required, but they are encouraged by educators. Only 69% of 4-year-old American children are enrolled in preschool. Preschool age ranges anywhere from 3 to 5 years old. The curriculum for the day will consist of music, art, pretend play, science, reading, math, and other social activities.\\n \\n K–12 education \\n [edit] K-12 education in the United States The U.S. is governed by federal, state, and local education policy. Education is compulsory for all children, but the age at which one can discontinue schooling varies by state and is from 14 to 18 years old.[120]\\n Free public education is typically provided from Kindergarten (ages 5 and 6) to 12th Grade (ages 17 and 18). Around 85% of students enter public schooling while the remainder are educated through homeschooling or privately funded schools.[121]\\n Schooling is divided into primary education, called elementary school, and secondary education.

Common admission requirements to gain entry to any American university requires a meeting a certain age threshold, high school transcript documenting grades, coursework, and rigor of core high school subject areas as well as performance in AP and IB courses, class ranking, ACT or SAT scores, extracurricular activities, an admissions essay, and letters of recommendation from teachers and guidance counselors. Other admissions criteria may include an interview, personal background, legacy preferences (family members having attended the school), ability to pay tuition, potential to donate money to the school development case, evaluation of student character (based on essays or interviews), and general discretion by the admissions office. While universities will rarely list that they require a certain standardized test score, class ranking, or GPA for admission, each university usually has a rough threshold below which admission is unlikely.\\n \\n Universities and colleges \\n [edit]  Brookings Hall Washington University in St. Louis The traditional path to American higher education is typically through a college or university, the most prestigious forms of higher education in the United States. Universities in the United States are institutions that issue bachelor's, master's, professional, or doctorate degrees; colleges often award solely bachelor's degrees.

Some counties and cities have established and funded four-year institutions. Some of these institutions, such as the City University of New York, are still operated by local governments. Others such as the University of Louisville and Wichita State University are now operated as state universities. Four-year institutions may be public or private colleges or universities. Private institutions are privately funded and there is a wide variety in size, focus, and operation. Some private institutions are large research universities, while others are small liberal arts colleges that concentrate on undergraduate education. Some private universities are nonsectarian and secular, while others are religiously affiliated.\\n \\n Rankings \\n [edit] QS World University Rankings Times Higher Education World University Rankings U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges Ranking Among the United States' most prominent and world-renowned institutions are large research universities that are ranked in such annual publications, including the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, QS World University Rankings, U.S. News & World Report, Washington Monthly, ARWU, by test preparation services such as The Princeton Review or by another university such as the Top American Research Universities ranked by The Center at the University of Florida.[126]  These rankings are based on factors such as brand recognition, number of Nobel Prize winners, selectivity in admissions, generosity of alumni donors, and volume and quality of faculty research.\\n Among the elite top forty domestically and internationally ranked institutions identified by the QS 2025 rankings include six of the eight Ivy League schools; private universities Stanford, The University of Chicago, and Johns Hopkins; 1 of the 10 schools in the University of California system (UC Berkeley); and the research intensive schools Caltech and MIT.[127]\\n Other types of universities in the United States include liberal arts schools (Reed College, Swarthmore College, Barnard College), religiously affiliated and denomination universities (DePaul University, Brigham Young University, Yeshiva University), military (United States Military Academy, United States Merchant Marine Academy, United States Naval Academy), art and design schools (Berklee College of Music, Juilliard School, Fashion Institute of Technology, Parsons School of Design, Rhode Island School of Design), Historically black colleges and universities (Morehouse College, Howard University, Kentucky\"),\n",

The American university curriculum varies widely depending on the program and institution. Typically, an undergraduate student will be able to select an academic \"major\" or concentration, which comprises the core main or special subjects, and students may change their major one or more times.\\n \\n Graduate degrees \\n [edit] Some students, typically those with a bachelor\\'s degree, may choose to continue on to graduate or professional school, which are graduate and professional institutions typically attached to a university. Graduate degrees may be either master\\'s degrees (e.g., M.A., M.S., M.S.W.), professional degrees (e.g. M.B.A., J.D., M.D.) or doctorate degrees (e.g. PhD). Programs range from full-time, evening and executive which allows for flexibility with students\\' schedules.[129] Academia-focused graduate school typically includes some combination of coursework and research (often requiring a thesis or dissertation to be written), while professional graduate-level schools grants a first professional degree. These include medical, law, business, education, divinity, art, journalism, social work, architecture, and engineering schools.\\n \\n Vocational \\n [edit] Vocational education in the United States Community and junior colleges in the United States are public comprehensive institutions that offer a wide range of educational services that generally lasts two years. Community colleges are generally publicly funded (usually by local cities or counties) and offer career certifications and part-time programs. Though it is cheaper in terms of tuition, less competitive to get into, and not as prestigious as going to a four-year university, they form another post-secondary option for students seeking to enter the realm of American higher education. Community and junior colleges generally emphasize practical career-oriented education that is focused on a vocational curriculum.[130] Though some community and junior colleges offer accredited bachelor\\'s degree programs, community and junior colleges typically offer a college diploma or an associate degree such as an A.A., A.S., or a vocational certificate, although some community colleges offer a limited number of bachelor\\'s degrees.

Generally, private universities charge much higher tuition than their public counterparts, which rely on state funds to make up the difference.\\n Annual undergraduate tuition varies widely from state to state, and many additional fees apply. In 2009, the average annual tuition at a public university for residents of the state was $7,020.[123] Tuition for public school students from outside the state is generally comparable to private school prices, although students can often qualify for state residency after their first year. Private schools are typically much higher, although prices vary widely from \"no-frills\" private schools to highly specialized technical institutes. Depending upon the type of school and program, annual graduate program tuition can vary from $15,000 to as high as $50,000. Note that these prices do not include living expenses (rent, room/board, etc.) or additional fees that schools add on such as \"activities fees\" or health insurance. These fees, especially room and board, can range from $6,000 to $12,000 per academic year (assuming a single student without children).[133]\\n The mean annual total cost, including all costs associated with a full-time post-secondary schooling, such as tuition and fees, books and supplies, room and board, as reported by collegeboard.com for 2010:[134]\\n Public university (4 years): $27,967 (per year) Private university (4 years): $40,476 (per year) Total, four-year schooling:\\n Public university: $111,868 Private university: $161,904 College costs are rising at the same time that state appropriations for aid are shrinking.

An increase of 6% occurred over the same period for private schools.[133] Between 1982 and 2007, college tuition and fees rose three times as fast as median family income, in constant dollars.[106]\\n From the U.S. Census Bureau, the median salary of an individual who has only a high school diploma is $27,967; the median salary of an individual who has a bachelor\\'s degree is $47,345.[135] Certain degrees, such as in engineering, typically result in salaries far exceeding high school graduates, whereas degrees in teaching and social work fall below.[136]\\n The debt of the average college graduate for student loans in 2010 was $23,200.[137]\\n A 2010 study indicates that the return on investment for graduating from the top 1,000 colleges exceeds 4% over a high school degree.[138]\\n \\n Student loan debt \\n [edit] In 2018, student loan debt topped $1.5 trillion. More than 40 million people hold college debt, which is largely owned by the U.S. government and serviced by private, for-profit companies such as Navient. Student loan debt has reached levels that have affected US society, reducing opportunities for millions of people following college.[139]\\n \\n Academic labor and adjunctification \\n [edit] According to Uni in the USA, \"One of the reasons American universities have thrived is due to their remarkable management of financial resources.\"[140] To combat costs colleges have hired adjunct professors to teach. In 2008, these teachers cost about $1,800 per 3-credit class as opposed to $8,000 per class for a tenured professor. Two-thirds of college instructors were adjuncts. There are differences of opinion on whether these adjuncts teach better or worse than regular professors. There is a suspicion that student evaluation of adjuncts, along with their subsequent continued employment, can lead to grade inflation.[141]\\n \\n Credential inflation \\n [edit] Economics professor Alan Zagier blames credential inflation for the admission of so many unqualified students into college. He reports that the number of new jobs requiring college degrees is less than the number of college graduates.[77] He states that the more money that a state spends on higher education, the slower the economy grows, the opposite of long-held notions.[77] Other studies have shown'),\n",

In other words, it is not enough simply to spend more time in school; something has to be learned there.\"[142]\\n \\n Governance and funding \\n [edit] Education policy of the United States Public school funding in the United States  \\n Governance \\n [edit] The national and state governments share power over public education, with the states exercising most of the control. Except for Hawaii, states delegate power to county, city or township-level school boards that exercise control over a school district. Some school districts may further delegate significant authority to principals, such as those who have adopted the Portfolio strategy.\\n The U.S. federal government exercises its control through its Department of Education. Though education is not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, federal governments traditionally employ threats of decreased funding to enforce laws pertaining to education.[143] Under recent administrations, initiatives such as the No Child Left Behind Act and Race to the Top have attempted to assert more central control in a heavily decentralized system.\\n Nonprofit private schools are widespread, are largely independent of the government, and include secular as well as parochial schools. Educational accreditation decisions for private schools are made by voluntary regional associations.\\n \\n Funding for K–12 schools \\n [edit]  school district   According to a 2005 report from the OECD, the United States is tied for first place with Switzerland when it comes to annual spending per student on its public schools, with each of those two countries spending more than $11,000.[1] However, the United States is ranked 37th in the world in education spending as a percentage of gross domestic product.[144]\\n Government figures exist for education spending in the United States per student, and by state. They show a very wide range of expenditures and a steady increase in per-pupil funding since 2011.[145][146][147]\\n Changes in funding appear to have little effect on a school system\\'s performance.

The average funding by state governments increased by 120% per student. However, scores in mathematics, science, and language arts over that same period remained almost unchanged. Multi-year periods in which a state\\'s funding per student declined substantially also appear to have had little effect.[148]\\n Property taxes as a primary source of funding for public education have become highly controversial, for a number of reasons. First, if a state\\'s population and land values escalate rapidly, many longtime residents may find themselves paying property taxes much higher than anticipated. In response to this phenomenon, California\\'s citizens passed Proposition 13 in 1978, which severely restricted the ability of the Legislature to expand the state\\'s educational system to keep up with growth. Some states, such as Michigan, have investigated or implemented alternative schemes for funding education that may sidestep the problems of funding based mainly on property taxes by providing funding based on sales or income tax. These schemes also have failings, negatively impacting funding in a slow economy.[149]\\n One of the biggest debates in funding public schools is funding by local taxes or state taxes. The federal government supplies around 8.5% of the public school system funds, according to a 2005 report by the National Center for Education Statistics.[150] The remaining split between state and local governments averages 48.7% from states and 42.8% from local sources.[150]\\n Rural schools struggle with funding concerns. State funding sources often favor wealthier districts. The state establishes a minimum flat amount deemed \"adequate\" to educate a child based on equalized assessed value of property taxes. This favors wealthier districts with a much larger tax base. This, combined with the history of slow payment in the state, leaves rural districts searching for funds. Lack of funding leads to limited resources for teachers. Resources that directly relate to funding include access to high-speed internet, online learning programs, and advanced course offerings.[151] These resources can enhance a student\\'s learning opportunities, but may not be available to everyone if a district cannot afford to offer specific programs. One study found that school districts spend less efficiently in areas in which they face little or no competition from other public schools, in large districts, and in areas in which residents are poor or less educated.[152] Some public schools are experimenting with recruiting teachers from developing countries in order to fill the teacher shortage, as U.S. citizens with college degrees are turning away from the demanding'),\n",

These challenges have relied on interpretations of state constitutions after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that school funding was not a federal obligation specified in the U.S. Constitution, whose authors left education funding and the management to states. (San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973)). The state court cases, beginning with the California case of Serrano v. Priest, 5 Cal.3d 584 (1971), were initially concerned with equity in funding, which was defined in terms of variations in spending across local school districts. More recently, state court cases have begun to consider what has been called \\'adequacy.\\' These cases have questioned whether the total amount of spending was sufficient to meet state constitutional requirements.\\n From 1985 to 1999, a United States district court judge required the state of Missouri to triple the budget of Kansas City Public Schools, although in the end, test scores in the district did not rise; the racial achievement gap did not diminish; and there was less, not more, integration.[154] Perhaps the most famous adequacy case is Abbott v. Burke, 100 N.J. 269, 495 A.2d 376 (1985), which has involved state court supervision over several decades and has led to some of the highest spending of any U.S. districts in the so-called Abbott districts. The background and results of these cases are analyzed in a book by Eric Hanushek and Alfred Lindseth.[155] That analysis concludes that funding differences are not closely related to student outcomes and thus that the outcomes of the court cases have not led to improved policies.\\n \\n State \\n [edit] Judicial intervention has even taken place at the state level. In McCleary v. Washington,[156] a Supreme Court decision that found the state had failed to \"amply\" fund public education for Washington\\'s 1 million school children. Washington state had budgeted $18.2 billion for education spending in the two-year fiscal period ending in July 2015. The state Supreme Court decided that this budget must be boosted by $3.3 billion in total by July 2019. On September 11, 2014, the state Supreme Court found'),\n",

On September 11, 2014, the state Supreme Court found the legislature in contempt for failing to uphold a court order to come up with a plan to boost its education budget by billions of dollars over the next five years. The state had argued that it had adequately funded education and said diverting tax revenue could lead to shortfalls in other public services.[157]\\n In 2023, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania ruled in William Penn School District v. Pennsylvania Department of Education that the Pennsylvania General Assembly had created \"manifest deficiencies\" between high-wealth and low-wealth school districts with \"no rational basis\" for the funding gaps. The ruling stated that the Pennsylvania Constitution\\'s Education Clause was \"clearly, palpably, and plainly violated because of a failure to provide all students with access to a comprehensive, effective, and contemporary system of public education that will give them a meaningful opportunity to succeed academically, socially, and civically.\"[158]\\n \\n Pensions \\n [edit] While the hiring of teachers for public schools is done at the local school district level, the pension funds for teachers are usually managed at the state level. Some states have significant deficits when future requirements for teacher pensions are examined. In 2014, these were projected deficits for various states: Illinois -$187 billion, Connecticut -$57 billion, Kentucky -$41 billion, Hawaii -$16.5 billion, and Louisiana -$45.6 billion. These deficits range from 184% to 318% of these states\\' annual total budget.[159]\\n \\n Funding for college \\n [edit] At the college and university level student loan funding is split in half; half is managed by the Department of Education directly, called the Federal Direct Student Loan Program (FDSLP). The other half is managed by commercial entities such as banks, credit unions, and financial services firms such as Sallie Mae, under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). Some schools accept only FFELP loans; others accept only FDSLP. Still others accept both, and a few schools will not accept either, in which case students must seek out private alternatives for student loans.[160]\\n Grant funding is provided by the federal Pell Grant program.\\n \\n Issues \\n [edit] \\n Affirmative action \\n [edit] Affirmative action in the United States  [161] In 2023 the Supreme Court decision, Students for Fair Admissions v.

Although the practice has been banned in an increasing number of states beginning in the 1970s, in 2024 only 33 out of 50 states have this ban and the remaining 17 states do not. The punishment virtually always consists of spanking the buttocks of a student with a paddle in a punishment known as \"paddling.\"[164] Students can be physically punished from kindergarten to the end of high school, meaning that even adults who have reached the age of majority are sometimes spanked by school officials.[164]\\n Although extremely rare relative to the overall U.S. student population, more than 167,000 students were paddled in the 2011–2012 school year in American public schools.[165] Virtually all paddling in public schools occurs in the Southern United States, however, with 70% of paddled students living in just five states: Mississippi, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, and Georgia.[165] The practice has been on a steady decline in American schools.[166]\\n \\n School safety and security \\n [edit] The National Center for Education Statistics reported statistics about public schools in the United States in 2013–2014. They stated that, during that time, 93% controlled access to their buildings during school hours, and that 88% have in place a written crisis response plan. They also reported that 82% of schools have a system that notifies parents in the event of an emergency. According to their report, 75% of schools have security cameras in use.[167]\\n During the 2015–16 school year in the United States, the National Center for Education Statistics reported the following: 9% of schools reported that one or more students had threatened a physical attack with a weapon. 95% of schools'),\n",

However, human rights advocacy group, Human Rights Watch, argues that the technology could also threaten the right to privacy and could pose a great risk to children of color.[172]\\n \\n Cheating \\n [edit] Academic dishonesty §\\xa0United States In 2006, A survey reported by Reader\\'s Digest found that 50% to 95% of American students admitted to having cheated in high school or college at one time or another, results that cast some doubt on measured academic attainment tests.[173]\\n \\n Curriculum \\n [edit]  U.S. President George W. Bush No Child Left Behind Act Hamilton High School Hamilton, Ohio Curricula in the United States can vary widely from district to district. Different schools offer classes centering on different topics, and vary in quality. Some private schools even include religious classes as mandatory for attendance. This raises the question of government funding vouchers in states with anti-Catholic Blaine Amendments in their constitution. This in turn has produced camps of argument over the standardization of curricula and to what degree it should exist. These same groups often are advocates of standardized testing, which was mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act. The goal of No Child Left Behind was to improve the education system in the United States by holding schools and teachers accountable for student achievement, including the educational achievement gap between minority and non-minority children in public schools.\\n While the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) has served as an educational barometer for the US since 1969 by administering standardized tests on a regular basis to random schools throughout the United States, efforts over the last decade at the state and federal levels have mandated annual standardized test'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Education_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=\" the United States, efforts over the last decade at the state and federal levels have mandated annual standardized test administration for all public schools across the country.[174]\\n Along with administering and scoring the annual standardized tests, in some cases the teachers are being scored on how well their own students perform on the tests. Teachers are under pressure to continuously raise scores to prove they are worthy of keeping their jobs. This approach has been criticized because there are so many external factors, such as domestic violence, hunger, and homelessness among students, that affect how well students perform.[175]\\n Schools that score poorly wind up being slated for closure or downsizing, which gives direct influence on the administration to result to dangerous tactics such as intimidation, cheating and drilling of information to raise scores.[176]\\n Uncritical use of standardized test scores to evaluate teacher and school performance is inappropriate, because the students' scores are influenced by three things: what students learn in school, what students learn outside of school, and the students' innate intelligence.[177] The school only has control over one of these three factors. Value-added modeling has been proposed to cope with this criticism by statistically controlling for innate ability and out-of-school contextual factors.[178][self-published source] In a value-added system of interpreting test scores, analysts estimate an expected score for each student, based on factors such as the student's own previous test scores, primary language, or socioeconomic status.  The difference between the student's expected score and actual score is presumed to be due primarily to the teacher's efforts.\\n \\n Content knowledge \\n [edit] There is debate over which subjects should receive the most focus, with astronomy and geography among those cited as not being taught enough in schools.[179][180][181] A major criticism of American educational curricula is that it overemphasizes math and reading skills without providing the content knowledge needed to understand the texts used to teach the latter. Poor students are more likely to lack said content knowledge, which contributes to the achievement gap in the United States.[182]\\n \\n Literacy \\n [edit] Reading skills are typically taught using a three cues system based on identifying meaning, sentence structure, and visual information such as the first letter in a word.[183][184] This method has been criticized by psychologists such as Timothy Shanahan for lacking a basis in scientific evidence, citing studies that find that good readers look at all the letters in a word.[185] According to J. Richard Gentry, teachers draw insufficient attention to spelling\"),\n",

Richard Gentry, teachers draw insufficient attention to spelling. Spelling is itself frequently taught in a confusing manner, such as with reading prompts that may use words that are above grade level.[186]\\n \\n English-language education \\n [edit] Schools in the 50 states, Washington, D.C., the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands, teach primarily in English, with the exception of specialized language immersion programs.[citation needed]\\n In 2015, 584,000 students in Puerto Rico were taught in Spanish, their native language.[187]\\n The Native American Cherokee Nation instigated a 10-year language preservation plan that involved growing new fluent speakers of the Cherokee language from childhood on up through school immersion programs as well as a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home.[188][189][190]\\n[191] In 2010, 84 children were being educated in this manner.[192]\\n As of 2000, some 9.7 million children aged 5 to 17 primarily speak a language other than English at home. Of those, about 1.3 million children do not speak English well or at all.[193]\\n \\n Mathematics \\n [edit] Mathematics education in the United States According to a 1997 report by the U.S. Department of Education, passing rigorous high-school mathematics courses predicts successful completion of university programs regardless of major or family income.[194][195] Starting in 2010, mathematics curricula across the country have moved into closer agreement for each grade level. The SAT, a standardized university entrance exam, has been reformed to better reflect the contents of the Common Core.[196] As of 2023, twenty-seven states require students to pass three math courses before graduation from high school, and seventeen states and the District of Columbia require four.[197]\\n \\n Sex education \\n [edit] Sex education in the United States  teenage pregnancy Almost all students in the U.S. receive some form of sex education at least once between grades 7 and 12; many schools begin addressing some topics as early as grades 4 or 5.[198] However, what students learn varies widely, because curriculum decisions are so decentralized. Many states have laws governing what is taught in sex education classes or allowing parents to opt out. Some state laws leave curriculum decisions to individual school districts.[199]\\n A 1999 study by the Guttmacher Institute found that most U.S. sex education courses in grades 7'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Education_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=' by the Guttmacher Institute found that most U.S. sex education courses in grades 7 through 12 cover puberty, HIV, STDs, abstinence, implications of teenage pregnancy, and how to resist peer pressure. Other studied topics, such as methods of birth control and infection prevention, sexual orientation, sexual abuse, and factual and ethical information about abortion, varied more widely.[200]\\n However, according to a 2004 survey, a majority of the 1,001 parent groups polled wants complete sex education in schools. The American people are heavily divided over the issue. Over 80% of polled parents agreed with the statement \"Sex education in school makes it easier for me to talk to my child about sexual issues\", while under 17% agreed with the statement that their children were being exposed to \"subjects I don\\'t think my child should be discussing\". 10% believed that their children\\'s sexual education class forced them to discuss sexual issues \"too early\". On the other hand, 49% of the respondents (the largest group) were \"somewhat confident\" that the values taught in their children\\'s sex ed classes were similar to those taught at home, and 23% were less confident still. (The margin of error was plus or minus 4.7%.)[201]\\n According to The 74, an American education news website, the United States uses two methods to teach sex education. Comprehensive sex education focuses on sexual risk reduction. This method focuses on the benefits of contraception and safe sex. The abstinence-emphasized curriculum focuses on sexual risk avoidance, discouraging activity that could become a \"gateway\" to sexual activities.[202]\\n \\n LGBT curriculum laws \\n [edit] Anti-LGBT curriculum laws in the United States At least 20 states have had their legislatures introduce derivative bills of the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act, including Arizona,[203] Georgia,[204] Iowa,[205][206] Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan,[207] Missouri,[208] Ohio,[209] Oklahoma,[210] Tennessee, and South Carolina.[211][212]\\n In April 2022, Alabama became the second state to pass a similar bill, with governor Kay Ivey signing House Bill 322, legislation which additionally requires all students to use either male or female bathrooms in Alabama public schools based on their biological sex. Some states have had similar provisions to Florida\\'s law since the 1980s, though they have never gained the name of \"Don\\'t Say Gay\" bills by critics until recently.[213][214]\\n \\n Textbook review and adoption'),\n",

A. Davis Company, W. W. Norton & Company, SAGE Publications, and Flat World Knowledge.\\n \\n Immigrant students and grade placement \\n [edit] The method of placing students in a specific grade based on birthday cut-off dates has often been used with immigrant children. A study conducted by Dylan Conger on the effects of grade placement on English learners found that schools are often rushed to make a decision on what grade an incoming student should be placed in, so they base their decision on the child\\'s birthday.[219] Unfortunately, teachers and staff are not always able to test the child\\'s knowledge to determine what grade level would be better for the students based on what they already know.[219] This can cause some difficulties for immigrant students.\\n A study conducted on teacher expectations of Somali Bantu refugee students found that teachers can hold expectations for students to already know certain material when they enter their classroom, such as how to use a computer or how to behave in a classroom.[220] When these students learned something that the teacher already'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Education_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=\" computer or how to behave in a classroom.[220] When these students learned something that the teacher already expected them to know, it was not given the same importance compared to learning something that was being taught in that grade level, such as math proficiency or computer use.[220] Things can become more difficult for students when entering in the middle of the academic year. A study focused on the impact of late arrivals for immigrant students found that, due to constant moving, students entering in the middle of the academic year encountered material they were not familiar with or ended up repeating material they had already learned.[221]\\n There is still limited research that has been conducted in the United States on the effects of placing immigrant students in a specific grade based on birthday cut-off dates. A study on Thailand's education policy on children of migrants, where students under 7 years were enrolled in kindergarten and older students in first grade, found that even though older students placed in first-grade classrooms were more obedient, the students had trouble connecting with their classmates and teacher had to address them differently due to their age.[222]\\n While data supports the theory that English-language (EL) literacy interventions are beneficial for students of all grade levels and socioeconomic status, including disadvantaged immigrant students, poor implementation of EL instruction has contributed to downward assimilation and long-term or permanent Limited English Proficiency (LEP) status for many immigrant youths.[223] LEP status serves as a nonacademic factor for student course enrollment, negatively affecting immigrant student learning opportunities by separating English-learning from other coursework.[224] Focus on English literacy, and organizational constraints such as immigrant student population, may take away needed resources from challenging academic courses, such as math and science courses that are less English-dependent, thereby impeding LEP students' educational opportunities and post-secondary education preparation.\\n \\n Inequality \\n [edit] Educational inequality in the United States \\n Racial achievement differences \\n [edit] Racial achievement gap in the United States  NAEP The racial achievement gap in the U.S. refers to the educational disparities between Black and Hispanic students compared with Asian and Caucasian students.[225] This disparity manifests itself in a variety of ways: African-American and Hispanic students are more likely to receive lower grades, score lower on standardized tests, drop out of high school, and are less likely to enter and complete college.[226]\\n Several reasons have been suggested for these disparities. One explanation is the disparity in income that exists between African Americans and Whites. This school of thought\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Education_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content='. One explanation is the disparity in income that exists between African Americans and Whites. This school of thought argues that the origin of this \"wealth gap\" is the slavery and racism that made it extremely difficult for African-Americans to accumulate wealth for almost 100 years after slavery was abolished. A comparable history of discrimination created a similar gap between Hispanics and Whites. This results in many minority children being born into low socioeconomic backgrounds, which in turn affects educational opportunities.[227]\\n Another explanation has to do with family structure. Professor Lino Graglia has suggested that Blacks and Hispanics are falling behind in education because they are increasingly raised in single-parent families.[228][229] Other scholars, meanwhile, have long and continuously argued against this myth of the black family, pointing instead to class and race-based oppressions along social and economic lines, as discussed below.[230][231][232][233][234]\\n Other explanations offered for the racial achievement gap include: social class, institutional racism, lower quality of schools and teachers in minority communities, and civil injustice. Most authors mention several such factors as influential on outcomes, both in the United States[235] and worldwide.[236]\\n  \\n Economic impact \\n [edit] Current education trends in the United States represent multiple achievement gaps across ethnicities, income levels, and geography. In an economic analysis, consulting firm McKinsey & Company reports that closing the educational achievement gap between the United States and nations such as Finland and Korea would have increased US GDP by 9–16% in 2008.[237]\\n Narrowing the gap between white students and black and Hispanic students would have added another 2–4% GDP, while closing the gap between poor and other students would have yielded a 3–5% increase in GDP, and that of under-performing states and the rest of the nation another 3–5% GDP. In sum, McKinsey\\'s report suggests, \"These educational gaps impose on the United States the economic equivalent of a permanent national recession.\"[237]\\n The households and demographics featuring the highest educational attainment in the United States are also among those with the highest household income and wealth. Thus, while the population of the U.S. is becoming increasingly educated on all levels, a direct link between income and educational attainment remains.[98]\\n ACT Inc. reports that 25% of US graduating high school seniors meet college-readiness benchmarks in English, reading, mathematics, and science.[238] Including the 22% of students who do not graduate on time, fewer than 20'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Education_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=' science.[238] Including the 22% of students who do not graduate on time, fewer than 20% of the American youth, who should graduate high school each year, do so prepared for college.[239] The United States has fallen behind the rest of the developed world in education, creating a global achievement gap that alone costs the nation 9–16% of potential GDP each year.[240]\\n \\n School to prison pipeline \\n [edit] The school-to-prison pipeline (SPP) is the disproportionate tendency of minors and young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds to become incarcerated, because of increasingly harsh school and municipal policies which mirror law enforcement methods. This inhibits many of these young adults from going to college.[241][242][243]\\n \\n Standardized testing \\n [edit] Requiring students to take standardized tests (everyone takes the same test under reasonably equal circumstances, and gets scored the same way) for college admissions is a controversial topic. These tests can create unequal opportunities for students based on their economic status, race, and ability status.  For example, students with dyslexia may not, through no fault of their own, read the test material as quickly or easily as students without dyslexia. Similarly, impoverished students who are hungry when they take the test due to food insecurity, or who did not sleep well due to noisy, overcrowded housing, often do not score as well as students who are healthy, well-nourished, and well-rested. Students in under-funded, low-income schools often have the disadvantage of larger class sizes taught by teachers with less experience. It is therefore common for students of color, those with disabilities, and those from low-income communities to have lower scores on academic tests.  While these lower scores may accurately reflect the individual student\\'s performance, the lower performance is most likely due to \"generations of exclusionary housing, education, and economic policy\", rather than anything an individual student could remedy on their own.[244] These achievement gaps aren\\'t a new concept. In 1991, the gap between the average scores of white students and those of black students was 0.91 standard deviations, while in 2020, the gap had decreased to 0.79 standard deviations.[244]\\n \\n Cost of taking tests \\n [edit] Taking university admissions tests can be costly for students, both in terms of optional test preparation programs and in the cost of registering for and attending test. The ACT and SAT can cost $55–$70 and $52–'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Education_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=' for and attending test. The ACT and SAT can cost $55–$70 and $52–$68 respectively.[245] Many wealthier students voluntarily take the tests multiple time to see the best score[246] they can get, and will submit \"super-scores\", or a score consisting of their best scores from each section. Students from low-income families cannot afford to take the test multiple times.\\n Students in low-income communities oftentimes do not have the same resources for test prep that their peers from more affluent backgrounds do. This discrepancy in resources available causes there to be a significant difference in the scores of students from different racial backgrounds. One study found that 59% of white students and 80% of Asian test takers are deemed \"college ready\"[247] by the SAT standards in comparison to the under 25% of Black students and under 33% of Hispanic/Latino students who are deemed \"college ready\". While the College Board reports that socioeconomic factors do not directly impact a student\\'s performance, it can indirectly impact it through the course of access to prep courses and better schooling – experiences outside the test itself that can heavily affect test scores.\\n \\n Reading and writing habits \\n [edit]  Berkeley Heights, New Jersey Libraries have been considered essential to educational goals.[248]\\nLibrary books are more readily available to Americans than to people in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Austria, and all the Mediterranean nations. The average American borrowed more library books in 2001 than his or her peers in Germany, Austria, Norway, Ireland, Luxembourg, France, and throughout the Mediterranean.[249]\\nAmericans buy more books than Europeans do.[249]\\n Teachers have been frustrated with the lack of parent involvement in the learning process, particularly in the earlier grades. Children spend about 26% of their time in school, sleep 37%, leaving about 37% of their time left over.[250] Teachers believe that parents are not supervising their children\\'s free time to encourage the learning process, such as basic literacy, which is crucial not only to later success in life but also to keep them out of prison.[251]\\n The 2003 National Adult Literacy Survey indicated that 70% of inmates in American prisons cannot read above a fourth grade level, which notes a \"link between academic failure and delinquency, violence and crime is welded to reading failure.\"[252]\\n \\n School Meals \\n [edit] School meal programs in the United States  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\n See also \\n [edit]'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Federalist_Party.txt'}, page_content=\"Federal Party (disambiguation) Federalist §\\xa0Political parties \\n\\n The Federalist Party was a conservative[7] and nationalist American political party and the first political party in the United States. It dominated the national government under Alexander Hamilton from 1789 to 1801. The party was defeated by the Democratic-Republican Party in 1800, and it became a minority party while keeping its stronghold in New England. It made a brief resurgence by opposing the War of 1812, then collapsed with its last presidential candidate in 1816. Remnants lasted for a few years afterwards.\\n The party appealed to businesses who favored banks, national over state government, manufacturing, and an army and navy. In world affairs, the party preferred Great Britain and strongly opposed involvement in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. The party favored centralization, federalism, modernization, industrialization, and protectionism.[2][8]\\n The Federalists called for a strong national government that promoted economic growth and fostered friendly relationships with Great Britain in opposition to Revolutionary France. The Federalist Party came into being between 1789 and 1790 as a national coalition of bankers and businessmen in support of Hamilton's fiscal policies. These supporters worked in every state to build an organized party committed to a fiscally sound and nationalistic government. The only Federalist president was John Adams. George Washington was broadly sympathetic to the Federalist program, but he remained officially non-partisan during his entire presidency. The Federalist Party controlled the national government until 1801, when it was overwhelmed by the Democratic-Republican opposition led by President Thomas Jefferson.[9]\\n Federalist policies called for a national bank, tariffs, and good relations with Great Britain as expressed in the Jay Treaty negotiated in 1794. Hamilton developed the concept of implied powers and successfully argued the adoption of that interpretation of the Constitution. The Democratic-Republicans led by Jefferson denounced most of the Federalist policies, especially the bank and implied powers, and vehemently attacked the Jay Treaty as a sell-out of republican values to the British monarchy. The Jay Treaty passed and the Federalists won most of the major legislative battles in the 1790s. They held a strong base in the nation's cities and in New England. They factionalized when President Adams secured peace with France, to the anger of Hamilton's larger faction.

After losing executive power, they decisively shaped Supreme Court policy for another three decades through Chief Justice John Marshall.[11]\\n \\n Origins \\n [edit] The term \"Federalist\" was previously used to refer to a somewhat different coalition of nationalists led by Washington, which advocated replacing the weaker national government under the Articles of Confederation with a new Constitution in 1789. This early coalition included Hamilton and James Madison.[12]\\n The Federalists of this time were rivaled by the Anti-Federalists, who opposed the ratification of the Constitution and objected to creating a stronger central government.[13] The critiques of the Constitution raised by the Anti-Federalists influenced the creation of the Bill of Rights.[14] Federalists responded to these objections by promising to add a bill of rights as amendments to the Constitution to satisfy these concerns, which aided in securing acceptance and ratification of the Constitution by the states. The new United States Congress, initially with a Federalist majority, submitted to the states a series of amendments to guarantee specific freedoms and rights; once ratified, these would become the first ten amendments to the Constitution.[15]\\n \\n Rise \\n [edit] First Party System  Upon taking office in 1789, President Washington nominated his wartime chief of staff Alexander Hamilton to the new office of Secretary of the Treasury. Hamilton wanted a strong national government with financial credibility, and he proposed the ambitious Hamiltonian economic program that involved the assumption of the state debts incurred during the American Revolution. This created a national debt and the means to pay it off, and it set up a national bank along with tariffs, with James Madison playing major roles in the program. Parties were considered to be divisive and harmful to republicanism,[16] and no similar parties existed anywhere in the world.[9]\\n By 1789, Hamilton started building a nationwide coalition (a \"Pro-Administration\" faction), realizing the need for vocal political support in the states. He formed connections with like-minded nationalists and used his network of treasury agents to link together friends of the government, especially merchants and bankers, in the new nation\\'s dozen major cities. His attempts to manage politics in the national capital to get his plans through Congress brought strong responses across the country. In the process, what began as a'),\n",

In the process, what began as a capital faction soon assumed status as a national faction and then as the new Federalist Party.[17] The Federalist Party supported Hamilton\\'s vision of a strong centralized government and agreed with his proposals for a national bank and heavy government subsidies. In foreign affairs, they supported neutrality in the war between France and Great Britain.[18]\\n  Alexander Hamilton John Trumbull Hamilton proposed to fund the national and state debts, and Madison and John J. Beckley began organizing a party to oppose it. This \"Anti-Administration\" faction became what is now called the Democratic-Republican Party, led by Madison and Thomas Jefferson.[19] This party attracted many Anti-Federalists who were wary of a centralized government.\\n By the early 1790s, newspapers started calling Hamilton supporters \"Federalists\" and their opponents \"Republicans\", \"Jeffersonians\", or \"Democratic-Republicans\". Jefferson\\'s supporters usually called themselves \"Republicans\" and their party the \"Republican Party\".[20] The Federalist Party became popular with businessmen and New Englanders, as Republicans were mostly farmers who opposed a strong central government. Cities were usually Federalist strongholds, whereas frontier regions were heavily Republican.[21] The Congregationalists of New England and the Episcopalians in the larger cities supported the Federalists, while other minority denominations tended toward the Republican camp. Catholics in Maryland were generally Federalists.[22]\\n The state networks of both parties began to operate in 1794 or 1795, and patronage became a factor. The winner-takes-all election system opened a wide gap between winners, who got all the patronage, and losers who got none. Hamilton had many lucrative Treasury jobs to dispense—there were 1,700 of them by 1801.[23] Jefferson had one part-time job in the State Department, which he gave to journalist Philip Freneau to attack the Federalists. In New York, George Clinton won the election for governor and used the vast state patronage fund to help the Republican cause.\\n Washington tried and failed to moderate the feud between his two top cabinet members.[24] He was re-elected without opposition in 1792. The Democratic-Republicans nominated New York\\'s Governor Clinton to replace Federalist John Adams as vice president, but Adams won. The balance of power in Congress was close, with some members still undecided between the parties. In early 1793, Jefferson secretly prepared resolutions introduced by Virginia Congressman William Branch Giles designed to'),\n",

In early 1793, Jefferson secretly prepared resolutions introduced by Virginia Congressman William Branch Giles designed to repudiate Hamilton and weaken the Washington Administration.[25] Hamilton defended his administration of the nation's complicated financial affairs, which none of his critics could decipher until the arrival in Congress of Republican Albert Gallatin in 1793.\\n Federalists counterattacked by claiming that the Hamiltonian program had restored national prosperity, as shown in one 1792 anonymous newspaper essay:[26] \\n To what physical, moral, or political energy shall this flourishing state of things be ascribed? There is but one answer to these inquiries: Public credit is restored and established. The general government, by uniting and calling into action the pecuniary resources of the states, has created a new capital stock of several millions of dollars, which, with that before existing, is directed into every branch of business, giving life and vigor to industry in its infinitely diversified operation. The enemies of the general government, the funding act and the National Bank may bellow tyranny, aristocracy, and speculators through the Union and repeat the clamorous din as long as they please; but the actual state of agriculture and commerce, the peace, the contentment and satisfaction of the great mass of people, give the lie to their assertions. Jefferson wrote on 12 February 1798: \\n Two political Sects have arisen within the U. S. the one believing that the executive is the branch of our government which the most needs support; the other that like the analogous branch in the English Government, it is already too strong for the republican parts of the Constitution; and therefore in equivocal cases they incline to the legislative powers: the former of these are called federalists, sometimes aristocrats or monocrats, and sometimes tories, after the corresponding sect in the English Government of exactly the same definition: the latter are stiled republicans, whigs, jacobins, anarchists, disorganizers, etc. these terms are in familiar use with most persons.[27] \\n Religious dimension \\n [edit] In New England, the Federalist Party was closely linked to the Congregational church. When the party collapsed, the church was disestablished.[28] In 1800 and other elections, the Federalists targeted infidelity in any form. They repeatedly charged that Republican candidates were atheistic or anti-religious, especially Jefferson, Paine, and Franklin. Conversely, the Baptists, Methodists, and other dissenters favored the Republican cause.[29\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Federalist_Party.txt'}, page_content='. Conversely, the Baptists, Methodists, and other dissenters favored the Republican cause.[29] Jefferson told the Baptists of Connecticut that there should be a \"wall of separation\" between church and state, alluding to the writings of Rhode Island\\'s Roger Williams.[30][31]\\n \\n Effects of foreign affairs \\n [edit] International affairs—the French Revolution and the subsequent war between royalist Britain and republican France—decisively shaped American politics in 1793–1800 and threatened to entangle the country in wars that \"mortally threatened its very existence\".[32] The French revolutionaries guillotined King Louis XVI in January 1793, and subsequently declared war on Britain. The French king had been decisive in helping the United States achieve independence, but now he was dead and many of the pro-American aristocrats in France were exiled or executed. Federalists warned that American republicans threatened to replicate the horrors of the French Revolution and successfully mobilized most conservatives and many clergymen. The Republicans, some of whom had been strong Francophiles, responded with support even through the Reign of Terror, when thousands were guillotined, though it was at this point that many began backing away from their pro-France leanings.[33] Many of those executed had been friends of the United States, such as the Comte D\\'Estaing, whose fleet had fought alongside the Americans in the Revolution (Lafayette had already fled into exile, and Thomas Paine went to prison in France). The republicans denounced Hamilton, Adams and even Washington as friends of Britain, as secret monarchists, aristocrats and as enemies of the republican values. The level of rhetoric reached a fever pitch.[34][35]\\n In 1793, Paris sent a new minister, Edmond-Charles Genêt (known as Citizen Genêt), who systematically mobilized pro-French sentiment and encouraged Americans to support France\\'s war against Britain and Spain. Genêt funded local Democratic-Republican Societies that attacked Federalists.[36] He hoped for a favorable new treaty and for repayment of the debts owed to France. Acting aggressively, Genêt outfitted privateers that sailed with American crews under a French flag and attacked British shipping. He tried to organize expeditions of Americans to invade Spanish Louisiana and Spanish Florida. When Secretary of State Jefferson told Genêt he was pushing American friendship past the limit, Genêt threatened to go over the government\\'s head and rouse public opinion on behalf of France. Even Jefferson agreed'),\n",

Even Jefferson agreed this was blatant foreign interference in domestic politics. Genêt's extremism seriously embarrassed the Jeffersonians and cooled popular support for promoting the French Revolution and getting involved in its wars. Recalled to Paris for execution, Genêt kept his head and instead went to New York, where he became a citizen and married the daughter of Governor Clinton.[37] Jefferson left office, ending the coalition cabinet and allowing the Federalists to dominate.[38]\\n \\n Jay Treaty \\n [edit] The Jay Treaty battle in 1794–1795 was the effort by Washington, Hamilton and John Jay to resolve numerous difficulties with Britain. Some of these issues dated to the Revolution, such as boundaries, debts owed in each direction and the continued presence of British forts in the Northwest Territory. In addition, the United States hoped to open markets in the British Caribbean and end disputes stemming from the naval war between Britain and France. Most of all the goal was to avert a war with Britain—a war opposed by the Federalists, that some historians claim the Jeffersonians wanted.[39]\\n As a neutral party, the United States argued it had the right to carry goods anywhere it wanted. The British nevertheless seized American ships carrying goods from the French West Indies. The Federalists favored Britain in the war and by far most of America's foreign trade was with Britain, hence a new treaty was called for. The British agreed to evacuate the western forts, open their West Indies ports to American ships, allow small vessels to trade with the French West Indies and set up a commission that would adjudicate American claims against Britain for seized ships and British claims against Americans for debts incurred before 1775. One possible alternative was war with Britain, a war that the United States was ill-prepared to fight.[40]\\n The Republicans wanted to pressure Britain to the brink of war (and assumed that the United States could defeat a weak Britain).[41] Therefore, they denounced the Jay Treaty as an insult to American prestige, a repudiation of the American-French alliance of 1777 and a severe shock to Southern planters who owed those old debts and who would now be never compensated for their escaped slaves who fled to British lines for their freedom. Republicans protested against the treaty and organized their supporters. The Federalists realized they had to mobilize their popular vote, so they mobilized their newspapers, held rallies, counted votes and especially relied on the prestige of President Washington.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Federalist_Party.txt'}, page_content=' newspapers, held rallies, counted votes and especially relied on the prestige of President Washington. The contest over the Jay Treaty marked the first flowering of grassroots political activism in the United States, directed and coordinated by two national parties. Politics was no longer the domain of politicians as every voter was called on to participate. The new strategy of appealing directly to the public worked for the Federalists as public opinion shifted to support the Jay Treaty.[42] The Federalists controlled the Senate and they ratified it by exactly the necessary ⅔ vote (20–10) in 1795. However, the Republicans did not give up and public opinion swung toward the Republicans after the Treaty fight and in the South the Federalists lost most of the support they had among planters.[43]\\n \\n Whiskey Rebellion \\n [edit] Whiskey Rebellion The excise tax of 1791 caused grumbling from the frontier including threats of tax resistance. Corn, the chief crop on the frontier, was too bulky to ship over the mountains to market unless it was first distilled into whiskey. This was profitable as the United States population consumed per capita relatively large quantities of liquor. After the excise tax, the backwoodsmen complained the tax fell on them rather than on the consumers. Cash poor, they were outraged that they had been singled out to pay off the \"financiers and speculators\" back in the East and to pay the salaries of the federal revenue officers who began to swarm the hills looking for illegal stills.[44]\\n Insurgents in western Pennsylvania shut the courts and hounded federal officials, but Jeffersonian leader Albert Gallatin mobilized the western moderates and thus forestalled a serious outbreak. Washington, seeing the need to assert federal supremacy, called out 13,000 state militia and marched toward Washington, Pennsylvania to suppress this Whiskey Rebellion. The rebellion evaporated in late 1794 as Washington approached, personally leading the army (only two sitting Presidents have directly led American military forces, Washington during the Whiskey Rebellion and Madison in an attempt to save the White House during the War of 1812). The rebels dispersed and there was no fighting. Federalists were relieved that the new government proved capable of overcoming rebellion while Republicans, with Gallatin their new hero, argued there never was a real rebellion and the whole episode was manipulated in order to accustom Americans to a standing army.\\n Angry petitions flowed in from three dozen Democratic-Republican Societies created by Citizen Genêt. Washington attacked the societies as illegitimate and many disbanded. Federalists now ridiculed Republicans as \"'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Federalist_Party.txt'}, page_content='êt. Washington attacked the societies as illegitimate and many disbanded. Federalists now ridiculed Republicans as \"democrats\" (meaning in favor of mob rule) or \"Jacobins\" (a reference to the Reign of Terror in France).\\n \\nWashington refused to run for a third term, establishing a two-term precedent that was to stand until 1940 and eventually to be enshrined in the Constitution as the 22nd Amendment. He warned in his Farewell Address against involvement in European wars and lamented the rising north–south sectionalism and party spirit in politics that threatened national unity:  The party spirits serves always to distract the Public Councils, and enfeeble the Public Administration. It agitates the Community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another. Washington never considered himself a member of any party, but broadly supported most Federalist policies.[45]\\n \\n Newspaper editors at war \\n [edit] The spoils system helped finance Federalist printers until 1801 and Republican editors after that. Federalist Postmasters General, Timothy Pickering (1791–94) and Joseph Habersham (1795–1801) appointed and removed local postmasters to maximize party funding. Numerous printers were appointed as postmasters. They did not deliver the mail, but they did collect fees from mail users and obtained free delivery of their own newspapers and business mail.[46][47]\\n To strengthen their coalitions and hammer away constantly at the opposition, both parties sponsored newspapers in the capital (Philadelphia) and other major cities.[48] On the Republican side, Philip Freneau and Benjamin Franklin Bache blasted the administration with all the scurrility at their command. Bache in particular targeted Washington himself as the front man for monarchy who must be exposed. To Bache, Washington was a cowardly general and a money-hungry baron who saw the Revolution as a means to advance his fortune and fame; Adams was a failed diplomat who never forgave the French their love of Benjamin Franklin and who craved a crown for himself and his descendants; and Alexander Hamilton was the most inveterate monarchist of them all.[49]\\n The Federalists, with twice as many newspapers at their command, slashed'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Federalist_Party.txt'}, page_content=' them all.[49]\\n The Federalists, with twice as many newspapers at their command, slashed back with equal vituperation. John Fenno and \"Peter Porcupine\" (William Cobbett) were their nastiest penmen and Noah Webster their most learned. Hamilton subsidized the Federalist editors, wrote for their papers and in 1801 established his own paper, the New York Evening Post. Though his reputation waned considerably following his death, Joseph Dennie ran three of the most popular and influential newspapers of the period, The Farmer\\'s Weekly Museum, the Gazette of the United States and The Port Folio.[50]\\n \\n Ceremonies and civil religion \\n [edit]  The Federalists were conscious of the need to boost voter identification with their party. Elections remained of central importance, but the rest of the political calendar was filled with celebrations, parades, festivals, and visual sensationalism.[51] The Federalists employed multiple festivities, exciting parades, and even quasi-religious pilgrimages and \"sacred\" days that became incorporated into the American civil religion. George Washington was always their hero and after his death he became viewed as a sort of demigod looking down from heaven to bestow his blessings on the party. At first, the Federalists focused on commemorating the ratification of the Constitution and organized parades to demonstrate widespread popular support for the new Federalist Party. The parade organizers incorporated secular versions of traditional religious themes and rituals, thereby fostering a highly visible celebration of the nation\\'s new civil religion.[52]\\n The Fourth of July became a semi-sacred day—a status it has maintained for much of American history.[53] Its celebration in Boston emphasized national over local patriotism and included orations, dinners, militia musters, parades, marching bands, floats and fireworks. By 1800, the Fourth of July was closely identified with the Federalist Party. Republicans were annoyed and staged their own celebrations on the same day—with rival parades sometimes clashing with each other, which generated even more excitement and larger crowds. After the collapse of the Federalists starting in 1815, the Fourth of July became a nonpartisan holiday.[54][55]\\n \\n Adams administration: 1797–1801 \\n [edit] John Adams  Hamilton distrusted Vice President Adams—who felt the same way about Hamilton—but was unable to block his claims to the succession. The election of 1796 was the first partisan affair in the nation\\'s history and one of the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Federalist_Party.txt'}, page_content='. The election of 1796 was the first partisan affair in the nation\\'s history and one of the more scurrilous in terms of newspaper attacks. Adams swept New England and Jefferson the South, with the middle states leaning to Adams. Adams was the winner by a margin of three electoral votes and Jefferson, as the runner-up, became vice president under the system set out in the Constitution prior to the ratification of the 12th Amendment.[56]\\n The Federalists were strongest in New England, but also had strengths in the middle states. They elected Adams as president in 1796, when they controlled both houses of Congress, the presidency, eight state legislatures and ten governorships.[57]\\n Foreign affairs continued to be the central concern of American politics, for the war raging in Europe threatened to drag in the United States. Historian Sarah Kreps in 2018 argues the Federalist faction led by President Adams during the 1798 Quasi-War could correspond to \"today’s right-of-center party.\"[58]\\n The new president was a loner, who made decisions without consulting Hamilton or other \"High Federalists\". Benjamin Franklin once quipped that Adams was a man always honest, often brilliant and sometimes mad. Adams was popular among the Federalist rank and file, but had neglected to build state or local political bases of his own and neglected to take control of his own cabinet. As a result, his cabinet answered more to Hamilton than to himself. Hamilton was especially popular because he rebuilt the Army—and had commissions to give out.[59]\\n \\n Alien and Sedition Acts \\n [edit] After an American delegation was insulted in Paris in the XYZ affair (1797), public opinion ran strongly against the French. An undeclared \"Quasi-War\" with France from 1798 to 1800 saw each side attacking and capturing the other\\'s shipping. It was called \"quasi\" because there was no declaration of war, but escalation was a serious threat. At the peak of their popularity, the Federalists took advantage by preparing for an invasion by the French Army. To silence Administration critics, the Federalists passed the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798. The Alien Act empowered the President to deport such aliens as he declared to be dangerous. The Sedition Act made it a crime to print false, scandalous and malicious criticisms of the federal government, but it conspicuously failed to criminalize criticism of Vice President Thomas Jefferson.[60]\\n Several Republican newspaper editors were convicted under the Act and'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Federalist_Party.txt'}, page_content=' criticism of Vice President Thomas Jefferson.[60]\\n Several Republican newspaper editors were convicted under the Act and fined or jailed and three Democratic-Republican newspapers were shut down.[61] In response, Jefferson and Madison secretly wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions passed by the two states\\' legislatures that declared the Alien and Sedition Acts unconstitutional and insisted the states had the power to nullify federal laws.\\n Undaunted, the Federalists created a navy, with new frigates; and a large new army, with Washington in nominal command and Hamilton in actual command. To pay for it all, they raised taxes on land, houses and slaves, leading to serious unrest. In one part of Pennsylvania, the Fries\\' Rebellion broke out, with people refusing to pay the new taxes. John Fries was sentenced to death for treason, but received a pardon from Adams. In the elections of 1798, the Federalists did very well, but this issue started hurting the Federalists in 1799. Early in 1799, Adams decided to free himself from Hamilton\\'s overbearing influence, stunning the country and throwing his party into disarray by announcing a new peace mission to France. The mission eventually succeeded, the \"Quasi-War\" ended and the new army was largely disbanded. Hamiltonians called Adams a failure while Adams fired Hamilton\\'s supporters still in the cabinet.\\n Hamilton and Adams intensely disliked one another and the Federalists split between supporters of Hamilton (High Federalists) and supporters of Adams. Hamilton became embittered over his loss of political influence and wrote a scathing criticism of Adams\\' performance as president in an effort to throw Federalist support to Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. Inadvertently, this split the Federalists and helped give the victory to Jefferson.[62]\\n \\n Election of 1800 \\n [edit] United States presidential election, 1800 Adams\\'s peace moves proved popular with the Federalist rank and file and he seemed to stand a good chance of re-election in 1800. If the Three-Fifths Compromise had not been enacted, he most likely would have won reelection since many Federalist legislatures removed the right to select electors from their constituents in fear of a Democratic victory. Jefferson was again the opponent and Federalists pulled out all stops in warning that he was a dangerous revolutionary, hostile to religion, who would weaken the government, damage the economy and get into war with Britain. Many believed that if Jefferson won the election, it would be the end of the newly formed United States. The Republicans crusaded against the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Federalist_Party.txt'}, page_content=\" election, it would be the end of the newly formed United States. The Republicans crusaded against the Alien and Sedition laws as well as the new taxes and proved highly effective in mobilizing popular discontent.[24]\\n The election hinged on New York as its electors were selected by the legislature and given the balance of North and South, they would decide the presidential election. Aaron Burr brilliantly organized his forces in New York City in the spring elections for the state legislature. By a few hundred votes, he carried the city—and thus the state legislature—and guaranteed the election of a Republican president. As a reward, he was selected by the Republican caucus in Congress as their vice presidential candidate. Alexander Hamilton, knowing the election was lost anyway, went public with a sharp attack on Adams that further divided and weakened the Federalists.[63]\\n Members of the Republican Party planned to vote evenly for Jefferson and Burr because they did not want for it to seem as if their party was divided. The party took the meaning literally and Jefferson and Burr tied in the election with 73 electoral votes. This sent the election to the House of Representatives to break the tie. The Federalists had enough weight in the House to swing the election in either direction. Many would rather have seen Burr in the office over Jefferson, but Hamilton, who had a strong dislike of Burr, threw his political weight behind Jefferson. During the election, neither Jefferson nor Burr attempted to swing the election in the House of Representatives. Jefferson remained at Monticello to oversee the laying of bricks to a section of his home. Jefferson allowed for his political beliefs and other ideologies to filter out through letters to his contacts. Thanks to Hamilton's support, Jefferson would win the election and Burr would become his vice president.\\n The 1800 election marked the first time power had been transferred between opposing political parties, an act that occurred remarkably without bloodshed. Though there had been strong words and disagreements, contrary to the Federalists fears, there was no war and no ending of one-government system to let in a new one. His patronage policy was to let the Federalists disappear through attrition. Those Federalists such as John Quincy Adams (John Adams' own son) and Rufus King willing to work with him were rewarded with senior diplomatic posts, but there was no punishment of the opposition.[64]\\n \\n Federalists in opposition \\n [edit] Fisher Ames (1758–1808) of Massachusetts ranks as one of the more influential figures of his era.[65] Ames led Federalist ranks in\"),\n",

His acceptance of the Bill of Rights garnered support in Massachusetts for the new Constitution. His greatest fame came as an orator who defined the principles of the Federalist Party and the follies of the Republicans. Ames offered one of the first great speeches in American Congressional history when he spoke in favor of the Jay Treaty. Ames was part of Hamilton\\'s faction and cautioned against the excesses of democracy unfettered by morals and reason: \"Popular reason does not always know how to act right, nor does it always act right when it knows\".[66] He warned his countrymen of the dangers of flattering demagogues, who incite dis-union and lead their country into bondage: \"Our country is too big for union, too sordid for patriotism, too democratic for liberty. What is to become of it, He who made it best knows. Its vice will govern it, by practising upon its folly. This is ordained for democracies\".[67]\\n \\n Jefferson administration \\n [edit] Thomas Jefferson  Thomas Jefferson Jefferson had a very successful first term, typified by the Louisiana Purchase, which was supported by Hamilton, but opposed by most Federalists at the time as unconstitutional. Some Federalist leaders (Essex Junto) began courting Jefferson\\'s vice president and Hamilton\\'s nemesis Aaron Burr in an attempt to swing New York into an independent confederation with the New England states, which along with New York were supposed to secede from the United States after Burr\\'s election to Governor. However, Hamilton\\'s influence cost Burr the governorship of New York, a key in the Essex Junto\\'s plan, just as Hamilton\\'s influence had cost Burr the presidency nearly four years before. Hamilton\\'s thwarting of Aaron Burr\\'s ambitions for the second time was too much for Burr to bear. Hamilton had known of the Essex Junto (whom Hamilton now regarded as apostate Federalists) and Burr\\'s plans and opposed them vehemently. This opposition by Hamilton would lead to his fatal duel with Burr in July 1804.[68]\\n The thoroughly disorganized Federalists hardly offered any opposition to Jefferson\\'s reelection in 1804 and Federalists seemed doomed. Jefferson had taken away most of their patronage, including federal judgeships. The party now controlled only five state legislatures and seven governorships.

Their majorities in Congress were long gone, dropping in the Senate from 23 in 1796, and 21 in 1800 to only six in 1804.[69] In New England and in some districts in the middle states, the Federalists clung to power, but the tendency from 1800 to 1812 was steady slippage almost everywhere as the Republicans perfected their organization and the Federalists tried to play catch-up. Some younger leaders tried to emulate the Democratic-Republican tactics, but their overall disdain of democracy along with the upper class bias of the party leadership eroded public support. In the South, the Federalists steadily lost ground everywhere.[62]\\n The Federalists continued for several years to be a major political party in New England and the Northeast, but never regained control of the presidency or the Congress. With the death of Washington and Hamilton and the retirement of Adams, the Federalists were left without a strong leader as Chief Justice John Marshall stayed out of politics. However, a few younger leaders did appear, notably Daniel Webster. Federalist policies favored factories, banking and trade over agriculture and therefore became unpopular in the growing Western states. They were increasingly seen as aristocratic and unsympathetic to democracy. In the South, the party had lingering support in Maryland, but elsewhere was crippled by 1800 and faded away by 1808.[70]\\n Massachusetts and Connecticut remained the party strongholds. Historian Richard J. Purcell explains how well organized the party was in Connecticut:\\n It was only necessary to perfect the working methods of the organized body of office-holders who made up the nucleus of the party. There were the state officers, the assistants, and a large majority of the Assembly. In every county there was a sheriff with his deputies. All of the state, county, and town judges were potential and generally active workers. Every town had several justices of the peace, school directors and, in Federalist towns, all the town officers who were ready to carry on the party\\'s work. Every parish had a \"standing agent\", whose anathemas were said to convince at least ten voting deacons. Militia officers, state\\'s attorneys, lawyers, professors and schoolteachers were in the van of this \"conscript army\". In all, about a thousand or eleven hundred dependent officer-holders were described as the inner ring which could always be depended upon for their own and enough more votes within their control to decide an election'),\n",

This was the Federalist machine.[71] After 1800, the major Federalist role came in the judiciary. Although Jefferson managed to repeal the Judiciary Act of 1801 and thus dismissed many lower level Federalist federal judges, the effort to impeach Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1804 failed. Led by the last great Federalist, John Marshall as Chief Justice from 1801 to 1835, the Supreme Court carved out a unique and powerful role as the protector of the Constitution and promoter of nationalism.[72]\\n \\n Anti-War Party \\n [edit] As the wars in Europe intensified, the United States became increasingly involved. The Federalists restored some of their strength by leading the anti-war opposition to Jefferson and Madison between 1807 and 1814. President Jefferson imposed an embargo on Britain in 1807 as the Embargo Act of 1807 prevented all American ships from sailing to a foreign port. The idea was that the British were so dependent on American supplies that they would come to terms. For 15 months, the Embargo wrecked American export businesses, largely based in the Boston-New York region, causing a sharp depression in the Northeast. Evasion was common and Jefferson and Treasury Secretary Gallatin responded with tightened police controls more severe than anything the Federalists had ever proposed. Public opinion was highly negative and a surge of support breathed fresh life into the Federalist Party.[73]\\n As Jefferson refrained from seeking a third term, the Republicans nominated Madison for the presidency in 1808. Meeting in the first-ever national convention, Federalists considered the option of nominating Jefferson's Vice President George Clinton (who represented a different Clintonian party faction from New York, had run for the Republican candidacy in 1804 and had not wanted to become vice president) as their own candidate, but balked at working with him and again chose Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, their 1804 candidate. Madison lost New England excluding Vermont, but swept the rest of the country and carried a Republican Congress. Madison dropped the Embargo, opened up trade again and offered a carrot and stick approach. If either France or Britain agreed to stop their violations of American neutrality, the United States would cut off trade with the other country. Tricked by French Emperor Napoleon into believing France had acceded to his demands, Madison turned his wrath on Britain and the War of 1812 began.[74] Young Daniel Webster, running for Congress from New Hampshire in 18\"),\n",

Charles Cotesworth Pinckney successfully defended slavery at the Constitutional Convention and led the Federalist Party in the elections of 1804 and 1808. New York prior to 1799 and New Jersey prior to 1804 were slave states as well, and several leading northern Federalists from these states owned slaves, including John Jay and Philip Schuyler. Federalists supported the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793\\'s nearly unanimous passage through Congress, and the Federalist-aligned administration of George Washington signed the bill into law.[77]\\n After 1800, as their political base contracted to New England, Federalists were increasingly opposed to slavery, both on principle and because the Three-fifths Compromise gave a political advantage to their opponents, who gained increased representation because of the weight given to disenfranchised enslaved people. Rufus King was a prominent opponent of slavery and became the final Federalist presidential candidate in 1816.[78]\\n Recent scholarship has laid increasing emphasis on later Federalist opposition to slavery[79] \\nDay[80] states\\n However, Day argues that concerns about the political weight of the slaveholding states were more significant than moral opposition to slavery.\\n \\n Madison administration \\n [edit] James Madison  James Madison The nation was at war during the 1812 presidential election and war was the burning issue. Opposition to the war was strong in traditional Federalist strongholds in New England and New York, where the party made a comeback in the elections of 1812 and 1814. In their second national convention in 1812, the Federalists, now the peace party, nominated DeWitt Clinton, the dissident Republican Mayor of New York City and an articulate opponent of the war, who had followed his uncle George Clinton as the leader of the Clintonian faction after his death. Madison ran for reelection promising a relentless war against Britain and an honorable peace. Clinton, denouncing Madison\\'s weak leadership and incompetent'),\n",

Clinton, denouncing Madison\\'s weak leadership and incompetent preparations for war, could count on New England and New York. To win, he needed the middle states and there the campaign was fought out. Those states were competitive and had the best-developed local parties and most elaborate campaign techniques, including nominating conventions and formal party platforms. The Tammany Society in New York City highly favored Madison and the Federalists finally adopted the club idea in 1808. Their Washington Benevolent Societies were semi-secret membership organizations which played a critical role in every northern state as they held meetings and rallies and mobilized Federalist votes.[81] New Jersey went for Clinton, but Madison carried Pennsylvania and thus was reelected with 59% of the electoral votes. However, the Federalists gained 14 seats in Congress.\\n \\n Opposition to the War of 1812 and decline \\n [edit] The War of 1812 went poorly for the Americans for two years. Even though Britain was concentrating its military efforts on its war with Napoleon, the United States still failed to make any headway on land and was effectively blockaded at sea by the Royal Navy. The British raided and burned Washington, D.C. in 1814 and sent a force to capture New Orleans.\\n The war was especially unpopular in New England. The New England economy was highly dependent on trade and the British blockade threatened to destroy it entirely. In 1814, the British Navy finally managed to enforce their blockade on the New England coast, so the Federalists of New England sent delegates to the Hartford Convention in December 1814.\\n During the proceedings of the Hartford Convention, secession from the Union was discussed, though the resulting report listed a set of grievances against the Democratic-Republican federal government and proposed a set of Constitutional amendments to address these grievances. They demanded financial assistance from Washington to compensate for lost trade and proposed constitutional amendments requiring a two-thirds vote in Congress before an embargo could be imposed, new states admitted, or war declared. It also indicated that if these proposals were ignored, then another convention should be called and given \"such powers and instructions as the exigency of a crisis may require\". The Federalist Massachusetts Governor had already secretly sent word to England to broker a separate peace accord. Three Massachusetts \"ambassadors\" were sent to Washington to negotiate on the basis of this report.\\n By the time the Federalist \"ambassadors\" got to Washington, the war was over and news of Andrew Jackson\\'s stunning victory in the Battle of New'),\n",

The \"ambassadors\" hastened back to Massachusetts, but not before they had done fatal damage to the Federalist Party. The Federalists were thereafter associated with the disloyalty and parochialism of the Hartford Convention and destroyed as a political force. Across the nation, Republicans used the great victory at New Orleans to ridicule the Federalists as cowards, defeatists and secessionists. Pamphlets, songs, newspaper editorials, speeches and entire plays on the Battle of New Orleans drove home the point.[82]\\n \\n Federalist decline \\n [edit] The Federalists fielded their last presidential candidate (Rufus King) in 1816. With the party\\'s passing, partisan hatreds and newspaper feuds declined and the nation entered the \"Era of Good Feelings\". Federalism in states like Massachusetts gradually blended into the conservative wing of the Democratic-Republicans. In the 1824 presidential election, New Englanders from both parties supported Adams, a native of the region. However, a few old Federalist leaders, who never forgave Adams for abandoning them, formed a ticket of unpledged electors with radical Democratic-Republicans. This ticket was overwhelmingly defeated and likely would have voted for Crawford.[83]\\n Following 1824, no Federalist ran for governor of any state and most left for the National Republicans. After the dissolution of the final Federalist congressional caucus in 1825, the last traces of Federalist activity came in Delaware and Massachusetts local politics in the late 1820s. In other states there still technically existed Federalists (for example James Buchanan) but they were engaged in patronage with either Jackson or Adams. In Massachusetts, the Federalist Party ceased to function as a state organization in 1825, surviving only as a local Boston group for the next three years.[83] In Delaware, the Federalist Party lasted until 1826 and controlled the Delaware House of Representatives.[84] When Daniel Webster, representative of Boston, resigned in 1827 to run for U.S. Senator, a caucus of Federalists met in Boston to nominate his replacement. A young William Lloyd Garrison persuaded the caucus to choose the Federalist Harrison Gray Otis, who ultimately declined. The caucus then nominated the Anti-Jacksonian Benjamin Gorham, their original choice.[83]\\n In the 1828 presidential election, the Federalists were used as a scapegoat in Boston.

The Democratic Boston Statesman accused Adams of being a secret Hartford Federalist attempting to revive the \"reign of terror\" under his father. Adams responded by accusing the old Hartford Federalists of treason and attempting to dissolve the union to form their own confederation. The Jackson Republican, an ally of the Statesman and founded by former Federalist Theodore Lyman II, implicated Webster among the old Federalists Adams intended to impugn, leading to a libel suit. As a protest against Adams, several \"Federal young men\" who had been supporting Adams nominated a Federalist ticket of presidential electors. This ticket, headed by Otis and William Prescott Jr. and including three other members of the Hartford Convention, garnered a pitiful 156 votes in Boston and none elsewhere in the state. As with the previous election, Adams swept the city and state.[83]\\n That ticket, according to the best of knowledge of Samuel Eliot Morison, was \"the last ticket ever voted for that bore the name of the once powerful party of Washington and Hamilton.\"[83]\\n \\n Interpretations \\n [edit] Intellectually, Federalists were profoundly devoted to liberty. As Samuel Eliot Morison explained, they believed that liberty is inseparable from union, that men are essentially unequal, that vox populi (\"voice of the people\") is seldom if ever vox Dei (\"the voice of God\") and that sinister outside influences are busy undermining American integrity.[85] British historian Patrick Allitt concludes that Federalists promoted many positions that would form the baseline for later American conservatism, including the rule of law under the Constitution, republican government, peaceful change through elections, stable national finances, credible and active diplomacy and protection of wealth.[86]\\n In terms of \"classical conservatism\", the Federalists had no truck with European-style aristocracy, monarchy, or established religion. Historian John P. Diggins says: \"Thanks to the framers, American conservatism began on a genuinely lofty plane. James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, John Marshall, John Jay, James Wilson, and, above all, John Adams aspired to create a republic in which the values so precious to conservatives might flourish: harmony, stability, virtue, reverence, veneration, loyalty, self-discipline, and moderation. This was classical conservatism in its most authentic expression\".[5]\\n Federalists led the successful battles to abolish the international slave trade in New York City and the battle to abolish slavery'),\n",

Many Federalists also created space for women to have a significant political role, which was not evident on the Democratic-Republican side.[88]\\n The Federalists were dominated by businessmen and merchants in the major cities who supported a strong national government. The party was closely linked to the modernizing, urbanizing, financial policies of Alexander Hamilton. These policies included the funding of the national debt and also assumption of state debts incurred during the Revolutionary War, the incorporation of a national Bank of the United States, the support of manufactures and industrial development, and the use of a tariff to fund the Treasury. While it has long been accepted that commercial groups are in support of the Federalists and agrarian groups are in support of the Democratic-Republicans, recent studies have shown that support for Federalists was also evident in agrarian groups.[89] In foreign affairs, the Federalists opposed the French Revolution, engaged in the \"Quasi War\" (an undeclared naval war) with France in 1798–99, sought good relations with Britain and sought a strong army and navy. Ideologically, the controversy between Democratic-Republicans and Federalists stemmed from a difference of principle and style. In terms of style, the Federalists feared mob rule, thought an educated elite should represent the general populace in national governance and favored national power over state power. Democratic-Republicans distrusted Britain, bankers, merchants and did not want a powerful national government. The Federalists, notably Hamilton, were distrustful of \"the people\", the French and the Republicans.[90] In the end, the nation synthesized the two positions, adopting representative democracy and a strong nation state. Just as importantly, American politics by the 1820s accepted the two-party system whereby rival parties stake their claims before the electorate and the winner takes control of majority in state legislatures and the Congress and gains governorships and the presidency.\\n As time went on, the Federalists lost appeal with the average voter and were generally not equal to the tasks of party organization; hence they grew steadily weaker as the political triumphs of the Democratic-Republican Party grew.[91] For economic and philosophical reasons, the Federalists tended to be pro-British—the United States engaged in more trade with Great Britain'),\n",

During \"Mr. Madison\\'s War\", as they called it, the Federalists made a temporary comeback.[92] However, they lost all their gains and more during the patriotic euphoria that followed the war. The membership was aging rapidly,[93] but a few young men from New England did join the cause, most notably Daniel Webster.\\n After 1816, the Federalists had no national power base apart from John Marshall\\'s Supreme Court. They had some local support in New England, New York, eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware. After the collapse of the Federalist Party in the course of the 1824 presidential election, most surviving Federalists (including Daniel Webster) joined former Democratic-Republicans like Henry Clay to form the National Republican Party, which was soon combined with other anti-Jackson groups to form the Whig Party in 1833. By then, nearly all remaining Federalists joined the Whigs. However, some former Federalists like James Buchanan, Louis McLane and Roger B. Taney became Jacksonian Democrats.[94]\\n The \"Old Republicans\", led by John Randolph of Roanoke, refused to form a coalition with the Federalists and instead set up a separate opposition since Jefferson, Madison, Gallatin, Monroe, John C. Calhoun and Clay had in effect adopted Federalist principles of implied powers to purchase the Louisiana Territory and after the failures and lessons of the War of 1812 raised tariffs to protect factories, chartered the Second National Bank, promoted a strong army and navy and promoted internal improvements. All these measures were opposed to the strict construction of the Constitution, which was the formal basis of the Democratic-Republicans, but the drift of the party to support them could not be checked. It was aided by the Supreme Court, whose influence under John Marshall as a nationalizing factor now first became apparent. The whole change reconciled the Federalists to their absorption into the Democratic-Republican Party. Indeed, they claimed, with considerable show of justice, that the absorption was in the other direction: that the Democratic-Republicans had recanted and that the \"Washington-Monroe policy\", as they termed it after 1820, was all that Federalists had ever desired.[95]\\n The name \"Federalist\" came increasingly to be used in political rhetoric'),\n",

This did not prevent endorsements from state Federalist parties (such as in Pennsylvania), but he received the endorsement from the New York state Democratic-Republicans as well. The Virginia state Federalist Party rejected the Clinton–Ingersoll ticket and instead nominated Rufus King for President and William Richardson Davie for Vice President—this ticket earned 27% of the state vote and 2% of the national vote.\\n ^ The Federalist caucus did not even bother to make a formal nomination, although many Federalists supported Rufus King.\\n ^ Though the Federalists did not put forward a ticket in the 1820 election, Federalist presidential electors received a portion of the popular vote.\\n \\n Congressional representation \\n [edit] Party divisions of United States Congresses The affiliation of many Congressmen in the earliest years is an assignment by later historians. The parties were slowly coalescing groups; at first there were many independents. Cunningham noted that only about a quarter of the House of Representatives up until 1794 voted with Madison as much as two-thirds of the time and another quarter against him two-thirds of the time, leaving almost half as fairly independent.[97]\\n \\n See also \\n [edit] Blue light federalists Democratic-Republican Party Essex Junto Federalist Era First Party System List of political parties in the United States \\n References \\n [edit] ^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Classless_society.txt'}, page_content='Classless Inter-Domain Routing A classless society is a society in which no one is born into a social class like in a class society. Distinctions of wealth, income, education, culture, or social network might arise and would only be determined by individual experience and achievement in such a society.\\nThus, the concept posits not the absence of a social hierarchy but the uninheritability of class status. \\nHelen Codere defines social class as a segment of the community, the members of which show a common social position in a hierarchical ranking.[1] Codere suggest that a true class-organized society is one in which the hierarchy of prestige and social status is divisible into groups. Each group with its own social, economic, attitudinal and cultural characteristics, and each having differential degrees of power in community decision.[1]\\n Classless societies can be attained through numerous means, such as abolishing inheritance, establishing social ownership, and modeling after social structures as observed in MAREZ, Revolutionary Catalonia, and prehistorical tribes.\\n \\n Classlessness \\n [edit] The term classlessness has been used to describe different social phenomena.\\n In societies where classes have been abolished, it is usually the result of a voluntary decision by the membership to form such a society to abolish a pre-existing class structure in an existing society or to form a new one without any. This would include communes of the modern period such as various American utopian communities or the kibbutzim as well as revolutionary and political acts at the nation-state level such as the Paris Commune or the Russian Revolution. The abolition of social classes and the establishment of a classless society is the primary goal of anarchism, communism and libertarian socialism.\\n According to Ulrich Beck, classlessness is achieved with class struggle: \"It is the collective success with class struggle which institutionalizes individualization and dissolves the culture of classes, even under conditions of radicalizing inequalities\".[2] Essentially, classlessness will exist when the inequalities and injustice out ranks societies idea of the need for social ranking and hierarchy.\\n While Rolf Becker and Andreas Hadjar argue that class identity has weakened, in that \"class position no longer generates a deep sense of identity and belonging\",[3] others maintain that class continues to affect lives, such as how children\\'s success in education correlates with their parents\\' wealth.[4]\\n \\n Marxist definition \\n [edit] Pure communism In Marxist theory, tribal hunter-gatherer society, primitive communism,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Classless_society.txt'}, page_content=\"\\n [edit] Pure communism In Marxist theory, tribal hunter-gatherer society, primitive communism, was classless. Everyone was equal in a basic sense as a member of the tribe and the different functional assignments of the primitive mode of production, howsoever rigid and stratified they might be, did not and could not simply because of the numbers produce a class society as such. With the transition to agriculture, the possibility to make a surplus product, i.e. to produce more than what is necessary to satisfy one's immediate needs, developed in the course of development of the productive forces. According to Marxism, this also made it possible for a class society to develop because the surplus product could be used to nourish a ruling class which did not participate in production.\\n \\n Libertarian socialism \\n [edit] Libertarian socialism, also called left-libertarianism, social anarchism, social libertarianism and socialist libertarianism, is a group of anti-authoritarian socialist political philosophies that rejects socialism as the centralised state ownership and control of the economy, which they regard as state capitalism. Political philosophy is the study of fundamental questions about the government, state, justice, politics, liberty and the enforcement of a legal code by an authoritative body. According to Charles Larmore, the second approach sees political philosophy as the freedom to discipline one-self from the basic features of the human condition that make up the reality of political life.[5]\\n Libertarianism is a collection of political philosophies and movements that uphold liberty as a core principle.[6] Libertarians seek to maximize political freedom and autonomy, emphasizing freedom of choice, voluntary association and individual judgment.[7][8][9] Libertarians share a skepticism of authority and state power, but they diverge on the scope of their opposition to existing political and economic systems. Various schools of libertarian thought offer a range of views regarding the legitimate functions of state and private power, often calling for the restriction or dissolution of coercive social institutions.[10]\\n Past and present political philosophies and movements commonly described as libertarian socialist include anarchism (especially anarcho-communism, anarcho-syndicalism,[11] collectivist anarchism and mutualism)[12] as well as autonomism, communalism, participism, guild socialism,[13] revolutionary syndicalism and libertarian Marxist[14] philosophies such as council communism[15] and Luxemburgism[16] as well as some versions of utopian socialism[17] and individualist anarchism.[18][19][20][21]\\n \\n See\"),\n",

It was established in early 1985. Registrants of .us domains must be U.S. citizens, residents, or organizations – or foreign entities with a presence in the United States or any territory of the United States.[2] Most registrants in the U.S. have registered for .com, .net, .org and other gTLDs, instead of .us, which has primarily been used by state and local governments, even though private entities may also register .us domains.[3] The domain is managed by Registry Services, LLC, a domain name registry, on behalf of the United States Department of Commerce.[4]\\n The .us domain is less commonly used by American businesses and enterprises than the more international .com.[5]\\n \\n History \\n [edit] On February 15, 1985, .us was created as the Internet\\'s first ccTLD.[6][7] Its original administrator was Jon Postel of the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) at the University of Southern California (USC). He administered .us under a subcontract that the ISI and USC had from SRI International (which held the .us and the gTLD contract with the United States Department of Defense) and later Network Solutions (which held the .us and the gTLD contract with the National Science Foundation).\\n Postel and his colleague Ann Westine Cooper[8] codified the .us ccTLD\\'s policies in December 1992 as RFC 1386[9] and revised them the following June in RFC 1480. Registrants could only register third-level domains or higher in a geographic and organizational hierarchy. From June 1993 to June 1997, Postel delegated the vast majority of the geographic subdomains under .us to various public and private entities. .us registrants could register with the delegated manager for the specific zone they wished to register in, but not directly with the .us administrator. In July 1997, Postel instituted a \"50/500 rule\" that limited each delegated manager to 500 localities maximum, 50 in a given state.[10]\\n In June 1998, Postel raised the possibility of covering IANA operating costs by charging locality name registrars, who would pass the costs along to individual registrants. In September 1998, the United States Postal Service proposed funding the operations in order to assume control of .us, as part of a plan to diversify away from postage'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_.us.txt'}, page_content=\" in order to assume control of .us, as part of a plan to diversify away from postage revenue.[11] On October 1, 1998, the NSF transferred oversight of the .us domain to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States Department of Commerce.[12] Postel died that month, leaving his domain administration responsibilities with ISI. In December 2000, these responsibilities were transferred to Network Solutions, which had recently been acquired by Verisign.[10][13][14]\\n On October 26, 2001, Neustar was awarded the contract to administer .us. On April 24, 2002, second-level domains under .us became available for registration. One of the first .us domain hacks, icio.us, was registered on May 3, 2002, for the creation of the subdomain del.icio.us.[15][16] A moratorium was placed on additional delegations of locality-based namespaces, and Neustar became the default delegate for undelegated localities.[17] Neustar's contract was renewed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in 2007 and most recently in 2014.[10][18]\\n On March 31, 2019, the .us registry made it clear that under its Acceptable Use Policy it would not allow the sale of opioids through the .us top level domain.[19]\\n In Q2 2020, GoDaddy acquired Neustar's registry business.[20]\\n \\n Locality namespace \\n [edit] The .us ccTLD is historically organized under a complex locality namespace hierarchy. Until second-level registrations were introduced in 2002, .us permitted only fourth-level domain registrations of the form organization-name.locality.state.us, with some exceptions for government entities. Registrants of locality-based domains must meet the same criteria as in the rest of the .us ccTLD. Though the locality namespace is most commonly used for government entities, it is also open to registrations by private businesses and individuals. Since 2002, second-level domain registrations have eclipsed those in the locality namespace, and many local governments have transitioned to .org and other TLDs.[10] In the 2010s, the first top-level domains for U.S. cities became available as paid alternatives to third-level locality domains, including .nyc as an alternative to .new-york.ny.us.\\n Many locality-based zones of .us are delegated to various public and private entities known\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_.us.txt'}, page_content=\"us.\\n Many locality-based zones of .us are delegated to various public and private entities known as delegated managers. Domains in these zones are registered through the delegated manager, rather than through GoDaddy. As the delegated managers are expected to receive requests directly from registrants, few if any domain name registrars serve this space, possibly contributing to its lower visibility and utilization. RFC 1480 describes the rationale for the locality namespace's deep hierarchy and local delegation:[10]\\n One concern is that things will continue to grow dramatically, and this will require more subdivision of the domain name management. Maybe the plan for the US Domain is overkill on growth planning, but there has never been overplanning for growth yet. This hierarchical system has proven unappealing to companies that operate nationally or globally.[21]\\n As of October 31, 2013, 12,979 domains were registered under the locality namespace, of which 3,653 were managed by about 1,300 delegated managers while 9,326 were managed by Neustar as the de facto manager.[22] According to a 2013 survey of 539 delegated managers, 282 were state or local government agencies, while 98 were private individuals and 85 were commercial Internet service providers. Nearly 90% of the respondents offer domain registrations for free.[10]\\n The .au and .ca ccTLDs have also established third- and fourth-level locality namespaces, though the .ca locality namespace is no longer open to registrations. The .cn ccTLD maintains a third-level locality namespace in general use.\\n \\n States and territories  \\n [edit] A two-letter second-level domain is formally reserved for each U.S. state, federal territory, and the District of Columbia. Each domain corresponds to a USPS abbreviation. For example, .ny.us is reserved for websites affiliated with New York, while .va.us is for those affiliated with Virginia. Second-level domains are also reserved for five U.S. territories: .as.us for American Samoa, .gu.us for Guam, .mp.us for the Northern Mariana Islands, .pr.us for Puerto Rico, and .vi.us for the U.S. Virgin Islands. However, these domains go unused because each territory has its own ccTLD per ISO 3166-1 alpha-2: respectively, .as, .gu, .mp, .pr, and .vi.\\n A state's main government portal is usually found at the third\"),\n",

However, some state administrations prefer .gov domains: for example, California's government portal is located at www.ca.gov, while www.state.ma.us redirects to Massachusetts's portal at www.mass.gov. Fully spelled-out names of states are also reserved under .us,[10] so the State of Ohio's website was at one point available at www.ohio.us[23] in addition to the usual www.ohio.gov, with the former www.state.oh.us remaining as a redirect. Other than for state governments, no third-level domain registrations are permitted under state or territory second-level domains.\\n A few additional names are reserved at the second level for government agencies that are not subordinate to a state government:\\n fed.us for agencies of the U.S. federal government (which in practice generally use .gov)\\nExample: www.fs.fed.us (United States Forest Service) isa.us for interstate authorities created by interstate compacts\\nExample: www.imcc.isa.us (Interstate Mining Compact Commission) nsn.us for Native Sovereign Nations (which may also use -nsn.gov)\\nExample: www.mohegan.nsn.us (Mohegan Tribe) dni.us for distributed national institutes\\nExample: ccj.ncsc.dni.us (Conference of Chief Justices, part of the National Center for State Courts) \\n Locality domains \\n [edit] A large number of third-level domains are reserved for localities within states. Each fourth-level domain registration under this namespace follows the format organization-name.locality.state.us, where state is a state's two-letter postal abbreviation and locality is a hyphenated name that corresponds to a ZIP code or appears in a well-known atlas.[10]\\n Two values of organization-name are formally reserved across the entire locality namespace for city and county governments:[10]\\n ci.locality.state.us for city governments\\nExample: www.ci.davenport.ia.us (Davenport, Iowa) co.locality.state.us for county governments\\nExample: co.adams.id.us (Adams County, Idaho)\"),\n",

For example, the website of the City of Brunswick, Ohio, is located at www.brunswick.oh.us rather than www.ci.brunswick.oh.us, and the website of Delhi Township, Ohio, is located at delhi.oh.us instead of www.twp.delhi.oh.us.

Webpages were prohibited from linking outside the .kids.us namespace. On July 27, 2012, in response to declining usage and a petition by Neustar the previous year, the NTIA suspended .kids.us registrations. By that time, 651 domains were registered under .kids.us, and only five registrants (Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., PBS Kids, the Smithsonian Center for Education and Museum Studies, and Super-Fun Sports Inc operating trampoline.kids.us and trampolines.kids.us\"),\n",

The Adirondack High Peaks, a traditional list of 46 peaks over 4,000 feet (1,200\\xa0m), are popular hiking destinations. There are over 200 named lakes with the number of smaller lakes, ponds, and other bodies of water reaching over 3,000. Among the named lakes around the mountains are Lake George, Lake Placid, and Lake Tear of the Clouds. The region has over 1,200 miles (1,900\\xa0km) of river.[3]\\n Although the mountains are formed from ancient rocks more than 1 billion years old, geologically, the mountains are relatively young and were created during recent periods of glaciation. Because of this, the Adirondacks have been referred to as \"new mountains from old rocks.\" It is theorized that there is a hotspot beneath the region, which causes continued uplift at the rate of .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;'),\n",

The park was established in 1892 by the state legislature to protect the region\\'s natural resources and to provide recreational opportunities for the public. It covers over 20 percent of New York state\\'s land area.[5]\\n \\n Etymology \\n [edit] The word Adirondack is thought to come from the Mohawk word atirǫ́·taks meaning \"eaters of trees\".[1] The earliest written use of the name was in 1635 by Harmen Meyndertsz van den Bogaert in his Mohawk to Dutch glossary, found in his Journey into Mohawk Country. He spelled it Adirondakx and said that it stood for Frenchmen, meaning the Algonquians who allied with the French.[6] Another early use of the name, spelled Rontaks, was in 1729 by French missionary Joseph-François Lafitau. He explained that the word was used by the Iroquois as a derogatory term for groups of Algonquians who did not practice agriculture and therefore sometimes had to eat tree bark to survive harsh winters.[7]\\n The Mohawks had no written language, so Europeans used various phonetic spellings of the word,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Adirondack_Mountains.txt'}, page_content=\" The Mohawks had no written language, so Europeans used various phonetic spellings of the word, including Achkokx, Rondaxe, and Adirondax.[7] Such words were strongly associated with the region, but they were not yet considered a place name; an English map from 1761 labels the area simply Deer Hunting Country. In 1838, the mountains were named Adirondacks by Ebenezer Emmons, the State Geologist for the northern New York State Geological District.[8]\\n \\n History \\n [edit]  The first humans to live in the Adirondacks were Paleo-Indians who arrived around the 14th millennium\\xa0BC following the end of the Last Glacial Period. The earliest migrants arrived from the St. Lawrence River Valley to the north, and settled along the shores of the Champlain Sea.[9] During the Archaic Period (8000–1000\\xa0BC) this semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer Laurentian culture inhabited the Adirondacks; evidence of their presence includes a projectile point of red-brown chert found in 2007 at the edge of Tupper Lake.[9]\\n During an interval of roughly 11,000 years following the end of the Last Glacial Period, the climate of the Adirondacks gradually warmed, with the area's tundra being replaced by forests that were now able to grow.[9] During the transition between the Archaic and Woodland (1000\\xa0BC\\xa0– AD\\xa01000) periods, multiple different groups replaced the Laurentian culture—including the Sylvan Lake, River, Middlesex, Point Peninsula, and Owasco cultures.[10] By the time of the Owasco culture c.\\u20091\\xa0AD, maize and beans were being cultivated in the uplands of the Adirondacks.[9]\\n The first Iroquoian peoples, the Mohawk (or Kanyengehaga) and the Oneida (or Oneyotdehaga), arrived in the Adirondack region between 4,000 and 1,200 years ago. Both groups claimed the Adirondack Mountains as hunting grounds. According to Haudenosaunee historian Rick Hill, the region was considered a 'Dish with One Spoon,' symbolizing shared hunting resources between the groups. A group of Algonquian people, known as the Mahicans, also occupied the region, particularly the Hudson River Valley.[10]\\n These were the groups that the first European explorers of the\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Adirondack_Mountains.txt'}, page_content=' particularly the Hudson River Valley.[10]\\n These were the groups that the first European explorers of the area encountered. European presence in the area began with a battle between Samuel de Champlain and a group of Mohawks, in what is now Ticonderoga in 1609. The Jesuit missionary Isaac Jogues became the first recorded European to travel through the center of the Adirondacks, as the captive of a Mohawk hunting party, in 1642.[7]\\n The early European perception of the Adirondacks was of a vast, inhospitable wilderness. One map of the area from 1771 shows the region as a blank space in the northeastern corner of New York. In 1784, Thomas Pownhall wrote that the Native Americans referred to the area as \"the Dismal Wilderness, or the Habitation of Winter,\" and that the area was \"either not much known to them, or, if known, very wisely by them kept from the Knowledge of the Europeans.\"[11] He clearly had the impression that native people did not live within the Adirondack mountains.[9]\\n Because local Iroquoian and Algonquian tribes had been decimated first by smallpox and measles in the 1600s, then by wars with encroaching European settlers, there likely were very few people living in the region by the time Pownhall wrote his description. It is only relatively recently that numerous archaeological finds have definitively shown that Native Americans were indeed very present in the Adirondacks before European contact, hunting, making pottery, and practicing agriculture.[9]\\n The European impression of a wild region devoid of human connection set up a narrative about wilderness that would persist through the next 200-some years of the region\\'s history. While society\\'s perception of the Adirondacks\\' value changed, they were always seen as a land of natural resources and physical beauty, not of human history.[9] First the area was an inhospitable tangle, then a lucrative store of lumber.[11] After the American Revolutionary War, New York State gained ownership of most of the land in the region.[12]\\n Needing money to discharge war debts, the government sold nearly all the original public acreage about 7\\xa0million acres for pennies an acre. Lumbermen were welcomed to the interior, with few restraints, resulting in massive deforestation.[12] Later, the wilderness character of the region became popular with the rise of the Romantic movement, and the Adirondacks became a destination for those'),\n",

Rising concern over water quality and deforestation led to the creation of the Adirondack Park in 1885.[11] In 1989, part of the Adirondack region was designated by UNESCO as the Champlain-Adirondack Biosphere Reserve.[13]\\n For the more recent human history of the Adirondack region, see Adirondack Park.\\n \\n Geology \\n [edit] The rocks of the Adirondack mountains originated about two billion years ago as 50,000 feet (ca. 15,240 m) thick sediments at the bottom of a sea located near the equator.[14] Because of plate tectonics these collided with Laurentia (the precursor of modern North America) in a mountain building episode known as the Grenville orogeny. During this time the sedimentary rock was changed into metamorphic rock. It is these Proterozoic minerals and lithologies that make up the core of the massif. Minerals of interest include:\\n wollastonite, mined near Harrisville magnetite and hematite, formerly mined at the Benson Mines,[15] Lyon Mountain, Mineville, Tahawus, and Witherbee. graphite, mined near Hague and Ticonderoga. garnet, mined at the Barton Mine, north of Gore Mountain. anorthosite, visible in road cuts on the New York State Route 3 between Saranac Lake and Tupper Lake.[16] marble zinc: The Balmat-Edwards district on the northwest flank of the massif also in St. Lawrence County was a major zinc ore deposit titanium was mined at Tahawus. The Adirondacks are uplifted by a hot spot in the Canadian Shield in contrast to other mountain ranges in New York which are a part of the Appalachian chain (not to be confused with the cultural region of Appalachia).[17]\\n Around 600\\xa0million years ago, as Laurentia drifted away from Baltica (European Craton), the area began to be pulled apart forming the Iapetus Ocean. Faults developed, running north to northeast which formed valleys and deep lakes. Examples visible today include the grabens Lake George and Schroon Lake. By this time the Grenville mountains had been eroded away and the area was covered by a shallow sea. Several thousand feet of sediment accumulated on the sea bed. Tr'),\n",

Several thousand feet of sediment accumulated on the sea bed. Trilobites were the principal life-form of the sea bed, and fossil tracks can be seen in the Potsdam sandstone floor of the Paul Smiths Visitor Interpretive Center.[16]\\n About 10\\xa0million years ago, the region began to be uplifted. It has been lifted about 7000 feet (ca. 2,134 meters) and is continuing at about 2 millimeters per year, which is greater than the rate of denudation. The cause of the uplift is unknown, but geologists theorize that it is caused by a hot spot in the Earth's crust.[16] A recent study has revealed a column of seismically slow materials about 50–80\\xa0km deep beneath the Adirondack Mountains,[18] which was interpreted to be the upwelling asthenosphere contributing to the uplift of the mountains. The occurrence of earthquake swarms near the center of the massif at Blue Mountain Lake may be evidence of this. Some of the earthquakes have exceeded 5 on the Richter magnitude scale.\\n  Whiteface Mountain New York Starting about 2.5\\xa0million years ago, a cycle of Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods began which covered the area in ice. During the most recent episode, the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered most of northern North America between about 95,000 and c. 20,000 years ago.[19] After this the climate warmed, but it took nearly 10,000 years for a 10,000 feet (ca. 3,048 m) thick layer of ice to completely melt. Evidence of this period includes:\\n Eskers: the Rainbow Lake esker bisects the eponymous lake and extends discontinuously for 85 miles (ca. 137\\xa0km). Another long discontinuous esker extends from Mountain Pond through Keese Mill, passing between Upper St. Regis Lake and the Spectacle Ponds, and continuing to Ochre, Fish, and Lydia Ponds in the St. Regis Canoe Area.

The Adirondacks typically experience pleasantly warm, rainy weather in the summer (June–August), with temperatures in the range of 66–73\\xa0°F (19–23\\xa0°C), cooler than the rest of New York State due to the higher elevation.

The forests of the Adirondacks include spruce, pine and deciduous trees. Lumbering, once an important industry, has been much restricted by the creation of state forest preserve.[23]\\n The mountains include many wetlands, of which there are three kinds:[16]\\n swamps, any wetland including trees and shrubs. marshes, wetlands with water stagnation. These may support bullfrogs, spring peepers, spotted salamanders, great blue herons, American bitterns, and painted turtles. Pickerel weed often forms large colonies. bogs, characterized by plants like sphagnum moss, orchids, and pitcher plants. Breeding birds include northern forest specialists not found anywhere else in the state, such as boreal chickadees, Canada jays, spruce grouse, black-backed woodpeckers, common loons and crossbills.[24] Mammals include raccoons, beavers, river otters, bobcats, moose, black bears, and coy'),\n",

Extirpated or extinct mammals that formerly roamed the Adirondacks include the eastern cougar, eastern elk, wolverine, caribou, eastern wolf, and the Canada lynx.[25] Attempted reintroductions of elk and lynx in the 20th century failed for numerous reasons, including poaching, vehicle collisions, and conservation incompetence.[26][27]\\n Nearly 60 percent of the park is covered with northern hardwood forest. Above 2,600 feet (790 meters), conditions are too poor for hardwoods to thrive, and the trees become mixed with or replaced by balsam fir and red spruce. Above 3,500 feet (1,100 meters) black spruce replace red. Higher still, only trees short enough to be covered in snow during the winter can survive.\\n A small area on the highest peaks exists above the tree line and has an alpine climate. These areas are covered by plants which occupied a large lowland tundra following the most recent period of glaciation.

In Colonial America, a few German Quakers issued the 1688 Germantown Quaker Petition Against Slavery, which marked the beginning of the American abolitionist movement. Before the Revolutionary War, evangelical colonists were the primary advocates for the opposition to slavery and the slave trade, doing so on the basis of humanitarian ethics. Still, others such as James Oglethorpe, the founder of the colony of Georgia, also retained political motivations for the removal of slavery. Prohibiting slavery through the 1735 Georgia Experiment in part to prevent Spanish partnership with Georgia\\'s runaway slaves, Oglethorpe eventually revoked the act in 1750 after the Spanish\\'s defeat in the Battle of Bloody Marsh eight years prior.[2]\\n During the Revolutionary era, all states abolished the international slave trade, but South Carolina reversed its decision. Between the Revolutionary War and 1804, laws, constitutions, or court decisions in each of the Northern states provided for the gradual or immediate abolition of slavery.[a] No Southern state adopted similar policies. In 1807, Congress made the importation of slaves a crime, effective January 1, 1808, which was as soon as Article I, section 9 of the Constitution allowed. A small but dedicated group, under leaders such as William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass, agitated for abolition in the mid-19th century.  John Brown became an advocate and militia leader in attempting to end slavery by force of arms. In the Civil War, immediate emancipation became a war goal for the Union in 1861 and was fully achieved in 1865.\\n \\n History \\n [edit] Origins of the American Civil War Slavery in the United States \\n In Colonial America \\n [edit]  1688 Germantown Quaker Petition Against Slavery American abolitionism began well before the United States was founded as a nation.

The law, however, was widely ignored,[10] and Rhode Island became involved in the slave trade in 1700.[11]\\n The first act of resistance against an upper-class white colonial government from slaves can be seen in Bacon\\'s Rebellion in 1676. Occurring in Virginia, the rebellion saw European indentured servants and African people (of indentured, enslaved, and free negroes) band together against William Berkeley because of his refusal to fully remove Native American tribes in the region. At the time, Native Americans in the region were hosting raids against lower-class settlers encroaching on their land after the Third Powhatan War (1644–1646), which left many white and black indentured servants and slaves without a sense of protection from their government.[12] Led by Nathaniel Bacon, the unification that occurred between the white lower class and blacks during this rebellion was perceived as dangerous and thus was quashed with the implementation of the Virginia Slave Codes of 1705.[13] Still, this event introduced the premise that blacks and whites could work together towards the goal of self-liberation, which became increasingly prevalent as abolition gained traction within America.[14]\\n  Samuel Sewall The first statement against slavery in Colonial America was written in 1688 by the Religious Society of Friends.[15] On 18 February 1688, Francis Daniel Pastorius, the brothers Derick and Abraham op den Graeff and Gerrit Hendricksz of Germantown, Pennsylvania, drafted the 1688 Germantown Quaker Petition Against Slavery, a two-page condemnation of slavery, and sent it to the governing bodies of their Quaker church. The intention of the document was to stop slavery within the Quaker community, where 70% of Quakers owned slaves between 1681 and 1705.[15] It acknowledged the universal rights of all people.[15] While the Quaker establishment did not take action at that time, the unusually early, clear, and forceful argument in the 1688 Germantown Quaker Petition Against Slavery initiated the spirit that finally led to the end of slavery in the Society of Friends (1776) and in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (1780). The Quaker Quarterly Meeting of Chester, Pennsylvania, made its first protest in 1711. Within a few decades the entire slave trade was under attack, being opposed by such Quaker leaders as William Burling, Benjamin Lay, Ralph Sandiford, William Southby,'),\n",

This is the earliest-recorded anti-slavery tract published in the future United States.[24]\\n Slavery was banned in the colony of Georgia soon after its founding in 1733. The colony's founder, James Edward Oglethorpe, fended off repeated attempts by South Carolina merchants and land speculators to introduce slavery into the colony. His motivations included tactical defense against Spanish collusion with runaway slaves, and prevention of Georgia's largely reformed criminal population from replicating South Carolina's planter class structure.

James Edward Oglethorpe [25] In 1737, Quaker abolitionist Benjamin Lay published All Slave-Keepers That Keep the Innocent in Bondage: Apostates,[26] which was printed by his friend, Benjamin Franklin.[27] The following year, during the 1738 Philadelphia Yearly Meeting in Burlington, New Jersey, Lay gave a  lecture against slavery while dressed as a soldier, after which he plunged a sword into a bible containing a bladder of\"),\n",

The runaway slaves involved in the revolt intended to reach Spanish-controlled Florida to attain freedom, but their plans were thwarted by white colonists in Charlestown, South Carolina.[30] The event resulted in 25 colonists and 35 to 50 African slaves killed, as well as the implementation of the 1740 Negro Act to prevent another slave uprising. In her book, \"The Slave\\'s Cause\" by Manisha Sinha, Sinha considers the Stono Rebellion to be an important act of abolition from the perspective of the slave, recognizing their agency and subsequent humanity as cause for self-liberation.[31]\\n \\nSlave revolts following the Stono Rebellion were a present mode of abolition undertaken by slaves and were an indicator of black agency that brewed beneath the surface of the abolitionist movement for decades and eventually sprouted later on through figures such as Frederick Douglass, an escaped black freeman who was a popular orator and essayist for the abolitionist cause.[32]  Benjamin Kent The struggle between Georgia and South Carolina led to the first debates in Parliament over the issue of slavery, occurring between 1740 and 1742.[25]\\n Rhode Island Quakers, associated with Moses Brown, were among the first in America to free slaves. Benjamin Rush was another leader, as were many Quakers. John Woolman gave up most of his business in 1756 to devote himself to campaigning against slavery along with other Quakers.[33]\\n Between 1764 and 1774, seventeen enslaved African Americans appeared before the Massachusetts courts in freedom suits, spurred on the decision made in the Somerset v. Stewart case, which although not applying the colonies was still received positively by American abolitionists.[34] Boston lawyer Benjamin Kent represented them.[35] In 1766, Kent won a case (Slew v. Whipple) to liberate Jenny Slew, a mixed-race woman who had been kidnapped in Massachusetts and then handled as a slave.[36]\\n According to historian Steven Pincus, many of the colonial legislatures worked to enact laws that would limit slavery.[37] The Provincial legislature of Massachusetts Bay, as noted by historian Gary B'),\n",

Nash, approved a law \"prohibiting the importation and purchase of slaves by any Massachusetts citizen.\"  The Loyalist governor of Massachusetts, Thomas Hutchinson, vetoed the law, an action that prompted angered reaction from the general public.[38][39] American abolitionists were cheered by the decision in Somerset v Stewart (1772), which prohibited slavery in the United Kingdom, though not in its colonies.[citation needed] In 1774, the influential Fairfax Resolves called for an end to the \"wicked, cruel and unnatural\" Atlantic slave trade.[40]\\n \\n Abolitionism during and after the Revolutionary War \\n [edit]  Thomas Paine One of the first articles advocating the emancipation of slaves and the abolition of slavery was written by Thomas Paine. Titled \"African Slavery in America\", it appeared on 8 March 1775 in the Postscript to the Pennsylvania Journal and Weekly Advertiser.[41]\\n The Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage (Pennsylvania Abolition Society) was the first American abolition society, formed 14 April 1775, in Philadelphia, primarily by Quakers. The society suspended operations during the American Revolutionary War and was reorganized in 1784, with Benjamin Franklin as its first president.[42][43]\\n In 1777, independent Vermont, not yet a state, became the first polity in North America to prohibit slavery: slaves were not directly freed, but masters were required to remove slaves from Vermont.[44]\\n The Constitution included several provisions which accommodated slavery, although none used the word. Passed unanimously by the Congress of the Confederation in 1787, the Northwest Ordinance forbade slavery in the Northwest Territory, a vast area (the future Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin) in which slavery had been legal, but population was sparse.[citation needed]\\n  The first state to begin a gradual abolition of slavery was Pennsylvania, in 1780. All importation of slaves was prohibited, but none were freed at first, only the slaves of masters who failed to register them with the state, along with the \"future children\" of enslaved mothers. Those enslaved in Pennsylvania before the 1780 law went into effect were not freed until 1847.[44]\\n Massachusetts took a much more radical position. In 1780, during the Revolution, Massachusetts ratified its constitution and included within it a clause that declared all men'),\n",

Based upon this clause, several freedom suits were filed by enslaved African Americans living in Massachusetts. In 1783, its Supreme Court, in the case of Commonwealth v. Nathaniel Jennison, reaffirmed the case of Brom and Bett v. Ashley, which held that even slaves were people who had a constitutional right to liberty. This gave freedom to slaves, effectively abolishing slavery.[45]\\n States with a greater economic interest in slaves, such as New York and New Jersey, passed gradual emancipation laws. While some of these laws were gradual, these states enacted the first abolition laws in the entire \"New World\".[46] In the State of New York, the enslaved population was transformed into indentured servants before being granted full emancipation in 1827. In other states, abolitionist legislation provided freedom only for the children of the enslaved. In New Jersey, slavery was not fully prohibited until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.[47]\\n  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 All of the other states north of Maryland began gradual abolition of slavery between 1781 and 1804, based on the Pennsylvania model and by 1804, all the Northern states had passed laws to gradually or immediately abolish it.[48][b] Some slaves continued in involuntary, unpaid \"indentured servitude\" for two more decades, and others were moved south and sold to new owners in slave states.[citation needed]\\n Some individual slaveholders, particularly in the upper South, freed slaves, sometimes in their wills. Many noted they had been moved by the revolutionary ideals of the equality of men. The number of free blacks as a proportion of the black population in the upper South increased from less than 1 percent to nearly 10 percent between 1790 and 1810 as a result of these actions. Some slave owners, concerned about the increase in free blacks, which they viewed as destabilizing, freed slaves on condition that they emigrate to Africa.[citation needed]\\n All U.S. states abolished the transatlantic slave trade by 1798. South Carolina, which had abolished the slave trade in 1787, reversed that decision in 1803. In the American South, freedom suits were rejected by the courts, which held that the rights in the state constitutions did not apply to African Americans.[49]\\n The formation of Christian denominations that heralded abolitionism as a moral issue occurred, such as the organization of Wesleyan Methodist Connection by Orange Scott in 1843, and the'),\n",

This was a direct result of the Union victory in the American Civil War. The central issue of the war was slavery.[54][55][56][57]\\n \\n Motives \\n [edit] Historian James M. McPherson in 1964 defined an abolitionist \"as one who before the Civil War had agitated for the immediate, unconditional and total abolition of slavery in the United States\". He notes that many historians have used a broader definition without his emphasis on immediacy. Thus he does not include opponents of slavery such as Abraham Lincoln or the Republican Party; they called for the immediate end to expansion of slavery before 1861.[58]\\n The religious component of American abolitionism was great. It began with the Quakers, then moved to the other Protestants with the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century. Many leaders were ministers. Saying slavery was sinful made its evil easy to understand, and tended to arouse fervor for the cause. The debate about slavery was often based on what the Bible said or did not say about it. John Brown, who had studied the Bible for the ministry, proclaimed that he was \"an instrument of God\".\\n As such, abolitionism in the United States was identified by historians as an expression of moralism,[59] it often operated in tandem with another social reform effort, the temperance movement. Slavery was also attacked, to a lesser degree, as harmful on economic grounds. Evidence was that the South, with many enslaved African Americans on plantations, was definitely poorer than the North, which had few.\\n \\n The South after 1804 \\n [edit] The institution remained solid in the South, and that region\\'s customs and social beliefs evolved into a'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Abolitionism_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content='] The institution remained solid in the South, and that region\\'s customs and social beliefs evolved into a strident defense of slavery in response to the rise of a growing anti-slavery stance in the North. In 1835 alone, abolitionists mailed over a million pieces of anti-slavery literature to the South, giving rise to the gag rules in Congress, after the theft of mail from the Charleston, South Carolina, post office, and much back-and-forth about whether postmasters were required to deliver this mail.[60]  According to the Postmaster General, they were not.[61]\\n Under the Constitution, the importation of enslaved persons could not be prohibited until 1808 (20 years). As the end of the 20 years approached, an Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves sailed through Congress with little opposition. President Jefferson signed it, and it went effect on January 1, 1808.\\n In 1820, the Act to Protect the Commerce of the United States and Punish the Crime of Piracy was passed. This law made importing slaves into the United States a death penalty offense. The Confederate States of America continued this prohibition with the sentence of death and prohibited the import of slaves.[citation needed]\\n \\n Abolitionism\\'s sudden emergence \\n [edit] \\nIn 1830, most Americans were, at least in principle, opposed to slavery. However, opponents of slavery deliberated on how to end the institution, as well as what would become of the slaves once they were free. As put in The Philanthropist:[62]:\\u200a59\\u200a \"If the chain of slavery can be broken,\\xa0... we may cherish the hope\\xa0... that proper means will be devised for the disposal of the blacks, and that this foul and unnatural crime of holding men in bondage will finally be rooted out from our land.\" In the 1830s there was a progressive shift in thinking in the North. Mainstream opinion changed from gradual emancipation and resettlement of freed blacks in Africa, sometimes a condition of their manumission, to immediatism: freeing all the slaves immediately and sorting out the problems later. This change was in many cases sudden, a consequence of the individual\\'s coming in direct contact with the horrors of American slavery, or hearing of them from a credible source.

Lloyd Garrison The Liberator American Anti-Slavery Society The American beginning of abolitionism as a political movement is usually dated from 1 January 1831, when Wm. Lloyd Garrison (as he always signed himself) published the first issue of his new weekly newspaper, The Liberator (1831), which appeared without interruption until slavery in the United States was abolished in 1865, when it closed.\\n \\n Immediate abolition \\n [edit] Abolitionists included those who joined the American Anti-Slavery Society or its auxiliary groups in the 1830s and 1840s, as the movement fragmented.[64]:\\u200a78\\u200a The fragmented anti-slavery movement included groups such as the Liberty Party; the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society; the American Missionary Association; and the Church Anti-Slavery Society. Historians traditionally distinguish between moderate anti-slavery reformers or gradualists, who concentrated on stopping the spread of slavery, and radical abolitionists or immediatists, whose demands for unconditional emancipation often merged with a concern for Black civil rights. However, James Stewart advocates a more nuanced understanding of the relationship of abolition and anti-slavery prior to the Civil War:\\n While instructive, the distinction [between anti-slavery and abolition] can also be misleading, especially in assessing abolitionism\\'s political impact. For one thing, slaveholders never bothered with such fine points. Many immediate abolitionists showed no less concern than did other white Northerners about the fate of the nation\\'s \"precious legacies of freedom\". Immediatism became most difficult to distinguish from broader anti-Southern opinions once ordinary citizens began articulating these intertwining beliefs.[64]:\\u200a78\\u200a Nearly all Northern politicians, such as Abraham Lincoln, rejected the \"immediate emancipation\" called for by the abolitionists, seeing it as \"extreme\". Indeed, many Northern leaders, including Lincoln, Stephen Douglas (the Democratic nominee in 1860), John C. Frémont (the Republican nominee in 1856), and Ulysses S. Grant married into slave-owning Southern families without any moral qualms.[citation needed]\\n Anti-slavery as a principle was far more than just the wish to prevent the expansion of slavery.[citation'),\n",

John Brown was the only abolitionist to have actually planned a violent insurrection, though David Walker promoted the idea. The abolitionist movement was strengthened by the activities of free African Americans, especially in the Black church, who argued that the old Biblical justifications for slavery contradicted the New Testament.\\n African-American activists and their writings were rarely heard outside the Black community. However, they were tremendously influential on a few sympathetic white people, most prominently the first white activist to reach prominence, Wm. Lloyd Garrison, who was its most effective propagandist. Garrison\\'s efforts to recruit eloquent spokesmen led to the discovery of ex-slave Frederick Douglass, who eventually became a prominent activist in his own right. Eventually, Douglass would publish his own widely distributed abolitionist newspaper, North Star.\\n  Lysander Spooner individualist anarchist The Unconstitutionality of Slavery In the early 1850s, the American abolitionist movement split into two camps over the question of whether the United States Constitution did or did not protect slavery. This issue arose in the late 1840s after the publication of The Unconstitutionality of Slavery by Lysander Spooner. The Garrisonians, led by Garrison and Wendell Phillips, publicly burned copies of the Constitution, called it a pact with slavery, and demanded its abolition and replacement.[citation needed] Another camp, led by Lysander Spooner, Gerrit Smith, and eventually Douglass, considered the Constitution to be an anti-slavery document. Using an argument based upon Natural Law and a form of social contract theory, they said that slavery fell outside the Constitution\\'s scope of legitimate authority and therefore should be abolished.[citation needed]\\n Another split in the abolitionist movement was along class lines. The artisan republicanism of Robert Dale Owen and Frances Wright stood in stark contrast to the politics of prominent elite abolitionists such as industrialist Arthur Tappan and his evangelist brother Lewis. While the former pair opposed slavery on a basis of solidarity of \"wage slaves\" with \"chattel slaves\", the Whiggish Tappans strongly rejected this view, opposing the characterization of Northern workers as \"slaves\" in any sense.

Nevertheless, participants like Harriet Tubman, Henry Highland Garnet, Alexander Crummell, Amos Noë Freeman, and others continued with their work. Abolitionists were particularly active in Ohio, where some worked directly in the Underground Railroad. Since only the Ohio River separated free Ohio from slave Kentucky, it was a popular destination for fugitive slaves. Supporters helped them there, in many cases to cross Lake Erie by boat, into Canada. The Western Reserve area of northeast Ohio was \"probably the most intensely antislavery section of the country.\"[66] The Oberlin-Wellington Rescue got national publicity. Abolitionist John Brown grew up in Hudson, Ohio. In the South, members of the abolitionist movement or other people opposing slavery were often targets of lynch mob violence before the American Civil War.[67]\\n Numerous known abolitionists lived, worked, and worshipped in downtown Brooklyn, from Henry Ward Beecher, who auctioned slaves into freedom from the pulpit of Plymouth Church, to Nathaniel Eggleston, a leader of the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society,[68] who also preached at the Bridge Street African Methodist Episcopal Church, and lived on Duffield Street. His fellow Duffield Street residents Thomas and Harriet Truesdell were leading members of the abolitionist movement. Mr. Truesdell was a founding member of the Providence Anti-slavery Society before moving to Brooklyn in 1838. Harriet Truesdell was also very active in the movement, organizing an anti-slavery convention in Pennsylvania Hall (Philadelphia). Another prominent Brooklyn-based abolitionist was Rev. Joshua Leavitt, trained as a lawyer at Yale, who stopped practicing law in order to attend Yale Divinity School, and subsequently edited the abolitionist newspaper The Emancipator and campaigned against slavery, as well as advocating other social reforms. In 1841, Leavitt published The Financial Power of Slavery, which argued that the South was draining the national economy due to its reliance on enslaved workers. In 2007, Duffield Street was given the name Abolitionist Place, and the Truesdells\\' home at 227 Duffield received landmark status in 2021.[69]\\n \\n'),\n",

Six months later, Pennsylvania Hall, an abolitionist venue in Philadelphia, was burnt to the ground by another proslavery mob on May 17, 1838. Both events contributed to the growing American debate over slavery and marked an increase in violence against abolitionists in the United States.[70]\\n Amos Dresser, a participant in the Lane Debates, was publicly whipped in Nashville. A gallows with a note from \"Judge Lynch\" was erected in front of Garrison\\'s office. He, along with the Tappans, was hung in effigy in Charleston, S.C. Southern post offices burned rather than delivered abolitionist publications, in which they were supported by the national Post Office. President Andrew Jackson called the abolitiinists\\' tracts \"unconstitutional and wicked.\"[71]:\\u200a106–107\\u200a\\n \\n Abolitionism at colleges \\n [edit] \\n Western Reserve College \\n [edit] Both Garrison\\'s newspaper The Liberator and his book Thoughts on African Colonization (1832) arrived shortly after publication at Western Reserve College, in Hudson, Ohio, which was briefly the center of abolitionist discourse in the United States. (John Brown grew up in Hudson.) The readers, including college president Charles Backus Storrs, found Garrison\\'s arguments and evidence convincing. Abolition versus colonization rapidly became the primary issue on the campus, to the point that Storrs complained in writing that nothing else was being discussed.[72]:\\u200a26\\u200a\\n The college\\'s chaplain and theology professor Beriah Green said that \"his Thoughts and his paper (The Liberator) are worthy of the eye and the heart of every American.\"[73]:\\u200a49\\u200a Green delivered in the college chapel in November and December 1832 four sermons supporting immediate abolition of slavery. These so offended the college\\'s trustees, more conservative than either the students or the faculty, that Green resigned, expecting that he would be fired.

Under the previous president, George Washington Gale, there had been a mass walkout of students; among the issues was Gale\\'s lack of support for abolition.\\n He accepted the position on conditions that 1) he be allowed to preach \"immediatism\", immediate emancipation, and 2) that African-American students be admitted on the same terms as white students. These were accepted, and we know the names of 16 Blacks who studied there. Native American students, of whom we know the names of two, were openly accepted as well.\\n Under Green, Oneida became \"a hotbed of anti-slavery activity.\"[72]:\\u200a44\\u200a It was \"abolitionist to the core, more so than any other American college.\"[72]:\\u200a46\\u200a For Presbyterian minister and Bible professor Green, slavery was not just an evil but a sin, and abolitionism was what Christ\\'s principles mandated. Under him a cadre of abolitionists was trained, who then carried the abolitionist message, via lectures and sermons, throughout the North. \\nMany future well-known black leaders and abolitionists were students at Oneida while Green was president. These include William Forten (son of James Forten), Alexander Crummell, Rev. Henry Highland Garnet and Rev. Amos Noë Freeman.\\n \\n Lane Seminary \\n [edit] Lane Seminary The Oneida Institute did not have an incident, like that of Western Reserve, which brought national attention to it. Its successor, Lane Seminary, in Cincinnati, did.\\n \"Lane was Oneida moved west.\"[74]:\\u200a55\\u200a Leading the exodus from Oneida was a former Oneida student, and private student of Gale before that, Theodore Dwight Weld. He greatly impressed the philanthropist brothers and abolitionists Arthur and Lewis Tappan. They hired him to report on the movement nationally,[75] and specifically to find a new location for their funding, since Oneida, a manual labor school, was a disappointment, according to Weld and his student followers.

(The manual labor school movement had students work about 3 hours a day on farms or in small factories or plants, such as Oneida\\'s printing shop, and was intended to provide needy students with funds for their education – a form of work-study – while at the same time providing them the newly recognized physical and psychological (spiritual) benefits of exercise).\\n At the same time that Weld was scouting a location for a new school, the barely-functioning Lane Seminary was looking for students. Based on Weld\\'s recommendation, the Tappans started giving Lane the financial support they had previously given Oneida. Weld, though on paper enrolled as a student at Lane, was de facto its head, choosing, through his recommendations to the Tappans, the president (Lyman Beecher, after Charles Grandison Finney, who became later the second president of Oberlin, turned it down), and telling the trustees whom to hire.[74]:\\u200a54\\u200a\\n The group of students led by Weld constituted the first student movement in the history of the country. He left Oneida, and they did. He chose Lane, and they followed him there. When he soon left Lane for another new, struggling institution, Oberlin, they did so too, as a group.\\n Students, many of whom considered him the real leader of Lane,[76]:\\u200a77\\u200a responded to Weld\\'s announcement of the new school in Cincinnati.\\n [Y]oung men gathered in Cincinnati \"as from the hives of the north\".

Even more arrived from Utica and Auburn, Finney\\'s converts all. From Tennessee came Weld\\'s disciple, Marius Robinson, and across the Ohio from Kentucky came James Thome, scion of a wealthy planting family. Up from Alabama journeyed two others of Weld\\'s disciples, the sons of the Rev. Dr. Allan. From Virginia came young Hedges; and from Missouri, Andrew, of the famous family of Benton. From the South came another, James Bradley, a Negro who had bought his freedom from slavery with the earnings of his own hands.

The theological class was the largest that had ever gathered in America, and its members were deeply conscious of their importance.[77]:\\u200a46\\u200a Lane ended up with about 100 students, the most of any seminary in America.\\n One of Weld\\'s key contentions (and of Puritan abolition sentiment in general) was that slavery was inherently anti-family. While slave marriage was illegal, it happened frequently. Slave owners expected their slaves to have many children to replace their numbers; Virginia and Maryland \"exported\" slaves to the Deep South — they were an asset like cattle — after Congress had banned the importation of slaves in 1808. Since slaves were property they were frequently bought and sold, ripping apart families. In his 1839 book American Slavery As It Is, Weld showed just how brutal the slave trade was towards families. To the very family-focused Puritans, this was one of the greatest crimes of slavery. Weld\\'s descriptions of families destroyed would later serve as the basis for scenes in Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin, including Uncle Tom\\'s being sold and separated from the children.[78]\\n \\n Lane Seminary debates \\n [edit] No sooner had this disparate group of former Oneida students and others arrived at Lane, under the leadership of Weld, than they formed an anti-slavery society. They then proceeded to hold a well-publicized series of debates on abolition versus African colonization, lasting 18 evenings, and decided that abolition was a much better solution to slavery. In fact no real debate took place, since no one appeared to defend colonization.[citation needed]\\n These \"debates\", which were well publicized, alarmed Lane\\'s president Lyman Beecher and the school\\'s trustees. Adding to their alarm were the classes the students were holding in the Black community, teaching Blacks to read. Fearing violence, since Cincinnati was strongly anti-abolitionist (see Cincinnati riots of 1829), they immediately prohibited any future such \"off-the-topic\" discussions and activities. The students, again led by Weld, felt that abolitionism was so important – it was their responsibility as Christians to promote it – and they resigned en masse, joined by Asa Mahan, a trustee who supported the students. With support from the Tappans, they briefly tried to establish a new seminary, but as this did not prove a practical solution they accepted a proposal that they move as'),\n",

Along with Garrison, Northcutt and Collins were proponents of immediate abolition. Abby Kelley Foster became an \"ultra abolitionist\" and a follower of William Lloyd Garrison. She led Susan B. Anthony as well as Elizabeth Cady Stanton into the anti-slavery cause.\\n  Frederick Douglass Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave My Bondage and My Freedom After 1840, \"abolition\" usually referred to positions similar to Garrison\\'s. It was largely an ideological movement led by about 3,000 people, including free blacks and free people of color, many of whom, such as Frederick Douglass in Rochester, New York, and Robert Purvis and James Forten in Philadelphia, played prominent leadership roles. Douglass became legally free during a two-year stay in England, as British supporters raised funds to purchase his freedom from his American owner Thomas Auld, and also helped fund his abolitionist newspapers in the United States.[79] Abolitionism had a strong religious base including Quakers, and people converted by the revivalist fervor of the Second Great Awakening, led by Charles Finney in the North, in the 1830s. Belief in abolition contributed to the formation of Christian denominations, such as the Free Methodist Church.\\n Evangelical abolitionists founded some colleges, most notably Bates College in Maine and Oberlin College in Ohio. The movement attracted such figures as Yale president Noah Porter and Harvard president Thomas Hill.[80]\\n  Charles Turner Torrey In the North, most opponents of slavery supported other modernizing reform movements such as the temperance movement, public schooling, and prison- and asylum-building. They were split on the issue of women\\'s activism and their political role, and this contributed to a major rift in the Society. In 1839, brothers Arthur Tappan and Lewis Tappan left the Society and formed the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, which did not admit women. Other members of the Society, including Charles Turner Torrey, Amos Phelps, Henry Stanton, and Alanson St. Clair, in addition to disagreeing with Garrison on the women\\'s issue, urged taking'),\n",

When the challenge was beaten back,[81] they left and founded the New Organization, which adopted a more activist approach to freeing slaves. Soon after, in 1840, they formed the Liberty Party, which had as its sole platform the abolition of slavery.[82] By the end of 1840, Garrison himself announced the formation of a third new organization, the Friends of Universal Reform, with sponsors and founding members including prominent reformers Maria Chapman, Abby Kelley Foster, Oliver Johnson, and Bronson Alcott (father of Louisa May Alcott).\\n Abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison repeatedly condemned slavery for contradicting the principles of freedom and equality on which the country was founded. In 1854, Garrison wrote:\\n I am a believer in that portion of the Declaration of American Independence in which it is set forth, as among self-evident truths, \"that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" Hence, I am an abolitionist. Hence, I cannot but regard oppression in every form – and most of all, that which turns a man into a thing – with indignation and abhorrence. Not to cherish these feelings would be recreancy to principle. They who desire me to be dumb on the subject of slavery, unless I will open my mouth in its defense, ask me to give the lie to my professions, to degrade my manhood, and to stain my soul. I will not be a liar, a poltroon, or a hypocrite, to accommodate any party, to gratify any sect, to escape any odium or peril, to save any interest, to preserve any institution, or to promote any object. Convince me that one man may rightfully make another man his slave, and I will no longer subscribe to the Declaration of Independence. Convince me that liberty is not the inalienable birthright of every human being, of whatever complexion or clime, and I will give that instrument to the consuming fire. I do not know how to espouse freedom and slavery together.[83] \\n Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin and The Impending Crisis of the South \\n [edit]  Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin The most influential abolitionist publication was Uncle Tom\\'s'),\n",

Outraged by the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 (which made the escape narrative part of everyday news), Stowe emphasized the horrors that abolitionists had long claimed about slavery. Her depiction of the evil slave owner Simon Legree, a transplanted Yankee who kills the Christ-like Uncle Tom, outraged the North, helped sway British public opinion against the South, and inflamed Southern slave owners who tried to refute it by showing that some slave owners were humanitarian.[85] Although incredibly influential to the abolitionist struggle, it also proved the largely white preference that abolition still carried during this time period, as a white woman\\'s retelling of American slavery became more influential during this time than several black abolitionist newspaper\\'s depictions of slavery.[86] It inspired numerous anti-Tom, pro-slavery novels, several written and published by women.\\n According to a book reviewer, \"Next to Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin (1852), Hinton Helper\\'s critique of slavery and the Southern class system, The Impending Crisis of the South (1857), was arguably the most important antislavery book of the 1850s.\"[87] According to historian George M. Fredrickson, \"it would not be difficult to make a case for The Impending Crisis as the most important single book, in terms of its political impact, that has ever been published in the United States.\"[88] Helper was a Southerner and a virulent racist, but he was nevertheless an abolitionist, because, as he argued in The Impending Crisis of the South, slavery hurt the economic prospects of non-slaveholders and was an impediment to the growth of the entire region of the South.\\n \\n The Constitution and ending slavery \\n [edit] \\n The Republican strategy of using the Constitution \\n [edit] Slavery and the United States Constitution Two diametrically opposed anti-slavery positions emerged regarding the United States Constitution.

They assumed that the Constitution gave the government no authority to abolish slavery directly. However, there were multiple tactics available to support the long-term strategy of using the Constitution as a battering ram against the peculiar institution. First Congress could block the admission of any new slave states. That would steadily move the balance of power in Congress and the Electoral College in favor of freedom. Congress could abolish slavery in the District of Columbia and the territories. Congress could use the Commerce Clause[89] to end the interstate slave trade, thereby crippling the steady movement of slavery from the southeast to the southwest. Congress could recognize free blacks as full citizens and insist on due process rights to protect fugitive slaves from being captured and returned to bondage. Finally, the government could use patronage powers to promote the anti-slavery cause across the country, especially in the border states. Pro-slavery elements considered the Republican strategy to be much more dangerous to their cause than radical abolitionism. Lincoln\\'s election was met by secession. Indeed, the Republican strategy mapped the \"crooked path to abolition\" that prevailed during the Civil War.[90][91]\\n \\n Events leading to emancipation \\n [edit] In the 1850s, the slave trade remained legal in all 16 states of the American South.  While slavery was fading away in the cities and border states, it remained strong in plantation areas that grew cash crops such as cotton, sugar, rice, tobacco or hemp. By the 1860 United States Census, the slave population in the United States had grown to four million.[92] American abolitionism, after Nat Turner\\'s revolt ended its discussion in the South, was based in the North, and white Southerners alleged it fostered slave rebellion.\\n The white abolitionist movement in the North was led by social reformers, especially William Lloyd Garrison, founder of the American Anti-Slavery Society, and writers such as John Greenleaf Whittier and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Black activists included former slaves such as Frederick Douglass, and free blacks such as the brothers Charles Henry Langston and John Mercer Langston, who helped to found the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society.[93][c]\\n Some abolitionists said that slavery was criminal and a sin; they also criticized slave owners for using black women as concubines and taking sexual advantage of them.[96]\\n \\n Compromise'),\n",

The Compromise of 1850 was proposed by \"The Great Compromiser\" Henry Clay; support was coordinated by Senator Stephen A. Douglas. Through the compromise, California was admitted as a free state after its state convention unanimously opposed slavery there, Texas was financially compensated for the loss of its territories northwest of the modern state borders, and the slave trade (not slavery) was abolished in the District of Columbia. The Fugitive Slave Law was a concession to the South. Abolitionists were outraged, because the new law required Northerners to help in the capture and return of runaway slaves.[97]\\n \\n Republican Party \\n [edit] History of the United States Republican Party In 1854, Congress passed the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which opened those territories to slavery if the local residents voted that way. The anti-slavery gains made in previous compromises were reversed. A firestorm of outrage brought together former Whigs, Know-Nothings, and former Free Soil Democrats to form a new party in 1854–56, the Republican Party. It included a program of rapid modernization involving the government promotion of industry, railroads, banks, free homesteads, and colleges, all to the annoyance of the South. The new party denounced the Slave Power – that is the political power of the slave owners who supposedly controlled the national government for their own benefit and to the disadvantage of the ordinary white man.[98]\\n The Republicans wanted to achieve the gradual extinction of slavery by market forces, because its members believed that free labor was superior to slave labor. Southern leaders said the Republican policy of blocking the expansion of slavery into the West made them second-class citizens, and challenged their autonomy. With the 1860 presidential victory of Abraham Lincoln, seven Deep South states whose economy was based on cotton and slavery decided to secede and form a new nation. The American Civil War broke out in April 1861 with the firing on Fort Sumter in South Carolina. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the rebellion, four more slave states seceded.\\n  temperance feminism Fourierism free love The crisis in Kansas Territory and the neighboring slave state of Missouri turned bloody during what was known as the Bleeding Kansas'),\n",

The violence would spread to many other places, including the Senate Chamber of the U.S. Capitol where a Southern Democrat attacked a Northern Republican with a cane as his political allies watched.\\n Explorer, army veteran, and abolitionist John C. Frémont ran as the first Republican nominee for president in 1856. The new party crusaded on the slogan: \"Free soil, free silver, free men, Frémont and victory!\" Although he lost, the party showed a strong base. It dominated in Yankee areas of New England, New York and the northern Midwest, and had a strong presence in the rest of the North. It had almost no support in the South, where it was roundly denounced in 1856–60 as a divisive force that threatened civil war.[99] The newly-formed Republican Party gained quite a standing in the 1856 to 1857 election cycle in the U.S. House and Senate, cementing its status as the primary party for abolitionists and northerners for some time.\\n Without using the term \"containment\", the new Party in the mid-1850s proposed a system of containing slavery once it gained control of the national government. Historian James Oakes explains the strategy:\\n The federal government would surround the south with free states, free territories, and free waters, building what they called a \"cordon of freedom\" around slavery, hemming it in until the system\\'s own internal weaknesses forced the slave states one by one to abandon slavery.[100] Militant abolitionists demanded immediate emancipation, not a slow-acting containment. Some rejected the new party, and in turn its leaders reassured voters they were not trying to abolish slavery in the U.S. altogether, which was politically impossible, and were just working against its spread.\\n \\n John Brown\\'s raid on Harpers Ferry \\n [edit] Virginia v.

Brown believed the South was on the verge of a gigantic slave uprising and that one spark would set it off.[citation needed] Brown\\'s supporters George Luther Stearns, Franklin B. Sanborn, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Theodore Parker, Samuel Gridley Howe, and Gerrit Smith were all abolitionists, members of the so-called Secret Six who provided financial backing for Brown\\'s raid. Brown\\'s raid, says historian David Potter, \"was meant to be of vast magnitude and to produce a revolutionary slave uprising throughout the South\".[105]\\n The raid did not go as expected. Brown hoped to have quickly a small army of runaway slaves, but made no provision to inform these potential runaways, although he got a little local support. Lt. Colonel Robert E. Lee of the U.S. Army was dispatched to put down the raid, and Brown was quickly captured. He was tried for treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, murder, and inciting a slave revolt, was found guilty of all charges, and was hanged. At his trial, Brown exuded a remarkable zeal and single-mindedness that played directly to Southerners\\' worst fears. Under Virginia law there was a month between the sentencing and the hanging, and in those weeks Brown spoke gladly with reporters and anyone else who wanted to see him, and wrote many letters. Few individuals did more to cause secession than John Brown, because Southerners believed he was right about an impending slave revolt.

This view of the war progressively changed, one step at a time, as public sentiment evolved, until by 1865 the war was seen in the North as primarily concerned with ending slavery. The first federal act taken against slavery during the war occurred on 16 April 1862, when Lincoln signed the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act, which abolished slavery in Washington, D.C. A few months later, on June 19, Congress banned slavery in all federal territories, fulfilling Lincoln\\'s 1860 campaign promise.[108] Meanwhile, the Union suddenly found itself dealing with a steady stream of thousands of escaped slaves, achieving freedom, or so they hoped, by crossing Union lines. In response, Congress passed the Confiscation Acts, which essentially declared escaped slaves from the South to be confiscated war property, and thus did not have to be returned to their Confederate owners. Although the initial act did not mention emancipation, the Second Confiscation Act, enacted on 17 July 1862, stated that escaped or liberated slaves belonging to anyone who participated in or supported the rebellion \"shall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude, and not again held as slaves.\" Pro-Union forces gained control of the border states of Maryland, Missouri, and West Virginia; all three states would abolish slavery before the end of the war. Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, effective 1 January 1863, which declared only those slaves in Confederate states to be free. The United States Colored Troops began operations in 1863. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was repealed in June 1864. Eventually support for abolition was enough to pass the Thirteenth Amendment, ratified in December 1865, which abolished slavery everywhere in the United States, freeing more than 50,000 people still enslaved in Kentucky and Delaware, in 1865 the only states in which slavery still existed.[109][110][111] The Thirteenth Amendment also abolished slavery among the Native American tribes.\\n \\n Variations by area \\n [edit]'),\n",

Quakers played a big role. The first abolition organization was the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, which first met in 1775; Benjamin Franklin was its president.[112] The New York Manumission Society was founded in 1785 by powerful politicians: John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, and Aaron Burr.\\n There is quite a bit of confusion about when slavery was abolished in the Northern states, because \"abolishing slavery\" meant different things in different states. (Theodore Weld, in his pamphlet opposing slavery in the District of Columbia, gives a detailed chronology.[113]) It is true that beginning with the independent Republic of Vermont in 1777, all states north of the Ohio River and the Mason–Dixon line that separated Pennsylvania from Maryland passed laws that abolished slavery, although in some cases this did not apply to existing slaves, only their future offspring. These included the first abolition laws in the entire New World:[46] the Massachusetts Constitution, adopted in 1780, declared all men to have rights, making slavery unenforceable, and it disappeared through the individual actions of both masters and slaves.[114]\\n However, what the abolition forces passed in 1799 in New York State was an Act for the gradual abolition of slavery.[115] Slavery in New York did not officially end until 1827, and more than 70 enslaved people in New York appeared on the 1830 decennial census. No slaves appeared in the state\\'s 1840 census.[116][117][118] New Jersey abolished slavery in 1804,[119] but in 1860 a dozen black people were still held as \"perpetual apprentices\".[120][121]\\n In the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, the Congress of the Confederation prohibited slavery in the territories northwest of the Ohio River.\\n At the Constitutional Convention of 1787, slavery was the most contentious topic. Outright prohibition of slavery was impossible, because the Southern states (Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware) would never have agreed to it. The only restriction on slavery that was agreed to was to allow Congress to prohibit the importation of slaves, and even that was postponed for 20 years.[122] By that time, all the states except South Carolina'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Abolitionism_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=' even that was postponed for 20 years.[122] By that time, all the states except South Carolina had laws abolishing or severely limiting the importation of slaves.[123] When 1808 approached, then-President Thomas Jefferson, in his 1806 annual message to Congress (State of the Union), proposed legislation, approved by Congress with little controversy in 1807, prohibiting the importation of slaves into the United States effective the first day the Constitution permitted, January 1, 1808. As he put it, this would \"withdraw the citizens of the United States from all further participation in those violations of human rights...which the morality, the reputation, and the best of our country have long been eager to proscribe\".[124][125] However, about 1,000 slaves per year continued to be illegally brought (smuggled) into the United States;[126] see Wanderer and Clotilda. This was primarily via Spanish Florida and the Gulf Coast;[127] the United States acquired Florida from Spain in 1819, effective 1821, in part as a slave-control measure: no imports coming in, and certainly no fugitives escaping into a refuge.\\n Congress declined to pass any restriction on the lucrative interstate slave trade, which expanded to replace the supply of African slaves (see Slavery in the United States#Slave trade).\\n \\n Manumission by Southern owners \\n [edit] After 1776, Quaker and Moravian advocates helped persuade numerous slaveholders in the Upper South to free their slaves. Manumissions increased for nearly two decades. Many individual acts by slaveholders freed thousands of slaves. Slaveholders freed slaves in such numbers that the percentage of free black people in the Upper South increased from 1 to 10 percent, with most of that increase in Virginia, Maryland and Delaware. By 1810 three-quarters of blacks in Delaware were free. The most notable of men offering freedom was Robert Carter III of Virginia, who freed more than 450 people by \"Deed of Gift\", filed in 1791. This number was more slaves than any single American had freed before or after.[128] Often slaveholders came to their decisions by their own struggles in the Revolution; their wills and deeds frequently cited language about the equality of men supporting the decision to set slaves free. The era\\'s changing economy also encouraged slaveholders to release slaves. Planters were shifting from labor-intensive tobacco to mixed-crop cultivation and needed fewer slaves.[129]\\n By 1860, 91.7% of the blacks in'),\n",

Such early free families often formed the core of artisans, professionals, preachers, and teachers in future generations.[129] However, this did not signal racial equality. Though free from slavery, blacks still faced immense discrimination. For example, Delaware affirmed and reaffirmed black disenfranchisement several times throughout the late 18th and 19th centuries. Delaware\\'s General Assembly enacted harsh black codes throughout the 19th century that restricted travel, property ownership, expression, and socialization for African Americans.[130]\\n \\n Western territories \\n [edit]  During Congressional debate in 1820 on the proposed Tallmadge Amendment, which sought to limit slavery in Missouri as it became a state, Rufus King declared that \"laws or compacts imposing any such condition [slavery] upon any human being are absolutely void, because contrary to the law of nature, which is the law of God, by which he makes his ways known to man, and is paramount to all human control\". The amendment failed and Missouri became a slave state. According to historian David Brion Davis, this may have been the first time in the world that a political leader openly attacked slavery\\'s perceived legality in such a radical manner.\\n Beginning in the 1830s, the U.S. Postmaster General refused to allow the mails to carry abolition pamphlets to the South.[131] Northern teachers suspected of abolitionism were expelled from the South, and abolitionist literature was banned. One Northerner, Amos Dresser (1812–1904), in 1835 was tried in Nashville, Tennessee, for possessing anti-slavery publications, convicted, and as punishment was whipped publicly.[132][133] Southerners rejected the denials of Republicans that they were abolitionists. They pointed to John Brown\\'s attempt in 1859 to start a slave uprising as proof that multiple Northern conspiracies were afoot to ignite slave rebellions. Although some abolitionists did call for slave revolts, no evidence of any other Brown-like conspiracy has been discovered.[134] The North felt threatened as well, for as Eric Foner concludes, \"northerners came to view slavery as the very antithesis of the good society, as well as a threat to their own fundamental values and interests\".[135] The famous, \"fiery\" abolitionist Abby Kelley Foster, from Massachusetts, was considered'),\n",

She held to the view that the freed slaves would colonize Liberia. Parts of the anti-slavery movement became known as \"Abby Kellyism\". She recruited Susan B Anthony and Lucy Stone to the movement. Effingham Capron, a cotton and textile scion, who attended the Quaker meeting where Abby Kelley Foster and her family were members, became a prominent abolitionist at the local, state, and national levels.[136] The local anti-slavery society at Uxbridge, Massachusetts, had more than 25% of the town\\'s population as members.[136]\\n \\n Abolitionist viewpoints \\n [edit] \\n Religion and morality \\n [edit] The Second Great Awakening of the 1820s and 1830s in religion inspired groups that undertook many types of social reform. For some that included the immediate abolition of slavery as they considered it sinful to hold slaves as well as to tolerate slavery.  Opposition to slavery, for example, was one of the works of piety of the Methodist Churches, which were established by John Wesley.[137] \"Abolitionist\" had several meanings at the time. The followers of William Lloyd Garrison, including Wendell Phillips and Frederick Douglass, demanded the \"immediate abolition of slavery\", hence the name, also called \"immediatism\". A more pragmatic group of abolitionists, such as Theodore Weld and Arthur Tappan, wanted immediate action, but were willing to support a program of gradual emancipation, with a long intermediate stage.\\n \"Anti-slavery men\", such as John Quincy Adams, did not call slavery a sin. They called it an evil feature of society as a whole. They did what they could to limit slavery and end it where possible, but were not part of any abolitionist group. For example, in 1841, John Quincy Adams represented the Amistad African slaves in the Supreme Court of the United States and argued that they should be set free.[138] In the last years before the war, \"anti-slavery\" could refer to the Northern majority, such as Abraham Lincoln, who opposed expansion of slavery or its influence, as by the Kansas–Nebraska Act or the Fugitive Slave Act. Many Southerners called all these abolitionists, without distinguishing them from the Garrisonians.\\n Historian James Stewart ('),\n",

They viewed the abolitionists as anti-Catholic and anti-Irish. Irish Catholics were generally well received by Democrats in the South.[139]\\n In contrast, most Irish Nationalists and Fenians supported the abolition of slavery. Daniel O\\'Connell, the Catholic leader of the Irish in Ireland, supported abolition in the United States. He organized a petition in Ireland with 60,000 signatures urging the Irish of the United States to support abolition. John O\\'Mahony, a founder of the Irish Republican Brotherhood was an abolitionist and served as colonel in the 69th Infantry Regiment during the Civil War.[140]\\n The Irish Catholics in the United States were recent immigrants; most were poor and very few owned slaves. They had to compete with free blacks for unskilled labor jobs. They saw abolitionism as the militant wing of evangelical anti-Catholic Protestantism.[141]\\n The Catholic Church in the United States had long ties[citation needed] in slaveholding Maryland and Louisiana. Despite a firm stand for the spiritual equality of black people, and the resounding condemnation of slavery by Pope Gregory XVI in his bull In supremo apostolatus issued in 1839, the American church continued in deeds, if not in public discourse, to avoid confrontation with slave-holding interests. In 1861, the Archbishop of New York wrote to Secretary of War Cameron: \"That the Church is opposed to slavery\\xa0... Her doctrine on that subject is, that it is a crime to reduce men naturally free to a condition of servitude and bondage, as slaves.\"  No American bishop supported extra-political abolition or interference with states\\' rights before the Civil War.\\n The secular Germans of the Forty-Eighter immigration were largely anti-slavery. Prominent Forty-Eighters included Carl Schurz and Friedrich Hecker. German Lutherans seldom took a position on slavery, but German Methodists were anti-slavery.\\n \\n Black'),\n",

Black abolitionists had the distinct problem of having to confront an often-hostile American public, while still acknowledging their nationality and struggle.[144] As a result, many black abolitionists \"intentionally adopted aspects of British, New England, and Midwestern cultures\".[144] Furthermore, much of abolitionist rhetoric, and black abolitionist rhetoric in particular, were influenced by the Puritan preaching heritage.[145]\\n \\n Abolitionist women \\n [edit]  Lucretia Mott William Lloyd Garrison\\'s abolitionist newsletter the Liberator noted in 1847, \"the Anti-Slavery cause cannot stop to estimate where the greatest indebtedness lies, but whenever the account is made up there can be no doubt that the efforts and sacrifices of the WOMEN, who helped it, will hold a most honorable and conspicuous position.\"[146] As the Liberator states, women played a crucial role as leaders in the anti-slavery movement.\\n  Angelina and Sarah Grimké were the first female anti-slavery agents, and played a variety of roles in the abolitionist movement. Though born in the South, the Grimké sisters became disillusioned with slavery and moved North to get away from it. Perhaps because of their birthplace, the Grimké sisters\\' critiques carried particular weight and specificity. Angelina Grimké spoke of her thrill at seeing white men do manual labor of any kind.[147] Their perspectives as native Southerners as well as women, brought a new important point of view to the abolitionist movement. In 1836, they moved to New York and began work for the Anti-Slavery Society, where they met and were impressed by William Lloyd Garrison.[148] The sisters wrote many pamphlets (Angelina\\'s \"Appeal to the Christian Women of the South\" was the only appeal directly to Southern women to defy slavery laws) and played leadership roles at the first Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women in 1837.[149] The Grimkés later made a notable speaking tour around'),\n",

Though well known for her women\\'s suffrage advocacy, Mott also played an important role in the abolitionist movement. During four decades, she delivered sermons about abolitionism, women\\'s rights, and a host of other issues. Mott acknowledged her Quaker beliefs\\' determinative role in affecting her abolitionist sentiment. She spoke of the \"duty (that) was impressed upon me at the time I consecrated myself to that Gospel which anoints \\'to preach deliverance to the captive, to set at liberty them that are bruised\\xa0...\"[150] Mott\\'s advocacy took a variety of forms: she worked with the Free Produce Society to boycott slave-made goods, volunteered with the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women, and helped slaves escape to free territory.[151]\\n Abby Kelley Foster, with a strong Quaker heritage, helped lead Susan B. Anthony and Lucy Stone into the abolition movement, and encouraged them to take on a role in political activism. She helped organize and was a key speaker at the first National Women\\'s Rights Convention, held in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1850. (The better-known Seneca Falls Convention, held in 1848, was not national).[152] She was an \"ultra\" abolitionist who believed in immediate and complete civil rights for all slaves. Since 1841, however, she had resigned from the Quakers over disputes about not allowing anti-slavery speakers in meeting houses (including the Uxbridge monthly meeting where she had attended with her family), and the group disowned her.[153][154][155] Abby Kelley became a leading speaker and the leading fundraiser for the American Anti-slavery Society. Radical abolitionism became known as \"Abby Kelleyism\".[156][157]\\n Other leaders in the abolitionist movement were Lydia Maria Child, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Harriet Tubman, and Sojourner Truth. But even beyond these well-known women, abolitionism maintained impressive support from white middle-class and some black women. It was these women who performed many of the logistical, day-to-day tasks that made the movement successful. They raised money, wrote and distributed propaganda pieces, drafted and'),\n",

They raised money, wrote and distributed propaganda pieces, drafted and signed petitions, and lobbied the legislatures. Though abolitionism sowed the seeds of the women\\'s rights movement, most women became involved in abolitionism because of a gendered religious worldview, and the idea that they had feminine, moral responsibilities.[158] For example, in the winter of 1831–1832, women sent three petitions to the Virginia legislature, advocating emancipation of the state\\'s slave population. The only precedent for such action was Catharine Beecher\\'s organization of a petition protesting the Cherokee removal.[159] The Virginia petitions, while the first of their kind, were by no means the last. Similar backing increased leading up to the Civil War.\\n Even as women played crucial roles in abolitionism, the movement simultaneously helped stimulate women\\'s-rights efforts. A full 10 years before the Seneca Falls Convention, the Grimké sisters were travelling and lecturing about their experiences with slavery. As Gerda Lerner says, the Grimkés understood their actions\\' great impact. \"In working for the liberation of the slave,\" Lerner writes, \"Sarah and Angelina Grimké found the key to their own liberation. And the consciousness of the significance of their actions was clearly before them. \\'We Abolition Women are turning the world upside down.\\'\"[160]\\n Women gained important experiences in public speaking and organizing that stood them in good stead going forward. The Grimké sisters\\' public speaking played a critical part in legitimizing women\\'s place in the public sphere. Some Christian women created cent societies to benefit abolition movements, where many women in a church would each pledge to donate one cent a week to help abolitionist causes.[161]\\n The July 1848 Seneca Falls Convention grew out of a partnership between Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton that blossomed while the two worked, at first, on abolitionist issues. Indeed, the two met at the World\\'s Anti-Slavery Convention in the summer of 1840.[162] Mott brought oratorical skills and an impressive reputation as an abolitionist to the nascent women\\'s rights movement.\\n Abolitionism brought together active women and enabled them to make political and personal connections while honing communication and organizational skills. Even Sojourner Truth, commonly associated with abolitionism, delivered her first documented public speech at the 1850 National Women\\'s Rights Convention in Worcester. There, she argued for women\\'s reform activism.[163]\\n \\n Anti-'),\n",

(See Radical Republicans.) Horace Greeley remarked in 1854 that he had \"never been able to discover any strong, pervading, over-ruling Anti Slavery sentiment in the Free States.\"[168] Free blacks were subject in the North as well as in the South to conditions almost inconceivable today (2019).[169]\\nAlthough the picture is neither uniform nor static, in general free blacks in the North were not citizens and could neither vote nor hold public office. They could not give testimony in court and their word was never taken against a white man\\'s word, as a result of which white crimes against blacks were rarely punished.[170]:\\u200a154–155\\u200a Black children could not study in the public schools, even though Black taxpayers helped support them,[94]:\\u200a154\\u200a and there were only a handful of schools for Black students, like the African Free School in New York, the Abiel Smith School in Boston, and the Watkins Academy for Negro Youth in Baltimore. When schools for negroes were set up in Ohio in the 1830s, the teacher of one slept in it every night \"for fear whites would burn it\", and at another, \"a vigilance committee threatened to tar and feather [the teacher] and ride her on a rail if she did not leave\".[74'),\n",

(Oberlin Collegiate Institute was the first college that survived to admit them by policy; the Oneida Institute was a short-lived predecessor.) In wages, housing, access to services, and transportation, separate but equal or Jim Crow treatment would have been a great improvement. The proposal to create the country\\'s first college for negros, in New Haven, Connecticut, got such strong local opposition (New Haven Excitement) that it was quickly abandoned.[172][173] Schools in which blacks and whites studied together in Canaan, New Hampshire,[174] and Canterbury, Connecticut,[175] were physically destroyed by mobs.\\n Southern actions against white abolitionists took legal channels: Amos Dresser was tried, convicted, and publicly whipped in Knoxville, and Reuben Crandall, Prudence Crandall\\'s younger brother, was arrested in Washington D.C., and was found innocent, although he died soon of tuberculosis he contracted in jail. (The prosecutor was Francis Scott Key.) In Savannah, Georgia, the mayor and alderman protected an abolitionist visitor from a mob.[176]\\n  Pennsylvania Hall Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society John Caspar Wild In the North there was far more serious violence by mobs, what the press sometimes called \"mobocracy\".[177] In 1837 Rev.

Only six months later, the large, modern, and expensive new hall which the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society built in Philadelphia in 1838, was burned by a mob three days after it opened. There were other anti-abolitionist riots in New York (1834), Cincinnati (1829, 1836, and 1841), Norwich, Connecticut (1834),[178] Washington, D.C. (1835), Philadelphia (1842), and Granville, Ohio (following the Ohio State Anti-Slavery Convention, 1836),[179] although there was also a pro-abolition riot (more precisely a pro-fugitive slave riot) in Boston in 1836[180] (and see Jerry Rescue).

Starting in the 1830s, Southerners developed a vehement and growing ideological defense of slavery.[188] Slave owners claimed that slavery was not a necessary evil, or an evil of any sort; slavery was a positive good for masters and slaves alike, and it was explicitly sanctioned by God. Biblical arguments were made in defense of slavery by religious leaders such as the Rev. Fred A. Ross and political leaders such as Jefferson Davis.[189] Southern Biblical interpretations contradicted those of the abolitionists; a popular one was that the curse on Noah\\'s son Ham and his descendants in Africa justified enslaving blacks.

The ACS enjoyed the support of prominent Southern leaders such as Henry Clay and James Monroe, who saw it as a convenient means of relocating free blacks, whom they perceived as a threat to their control over enslaved blacks. Starting in the 1820s, the ACS and affiliated state societies assisted a few thousand free blacks to move to the newly established colonies in West Africa that were to form the Republic of Liberia. From 1832 onward most of the migrants were enslaved people who had been freed on the condition that they go to Liberia.[citation needed] Many migrants died of local diseases, but enough survived for Liberia to declare independence in 1847. The Americo-Liberians formed a ruling elite whose treatment of the native population followed the lines of disdain for African culture they had acquired in America.[190]\\n Most African Americans opposed colonization, and simply wanted to be given the rights of free citizens in the United States. One notable opponent of such plans was the wealthy free black abolitionist James Forten of Philadelphia.\\n \\nIn 1832, prominent white abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison published his book Thoughts on African Colonization, in which he attacked severely the policy of sending blacks to (not \"back to\") Africa, and specifically the American Colonization Society. The Colonization Society, which he had previously supported, is \"a creature without heart, without brains, eyeless, unnatural, hypocritical, relentless and unjust.\"[191]:\\u200a15\\u200a \"Colonization\", according to Garrison, was not a plan to eliminate slavery, but to protect it. As it was put by a Garrison supporter: It is no object of the Colonization Society to ameliorate the condition of the slave.... The thing is, to get them out of the way; the welfare of the negro is not consulted at all.[191]:\\u200a13,\\u200a15\\u200a \\nGarrison also pointed out that a majority of the colonists died of disease, and the number of free blacks actually resettled in the future Liberia was minute in comparison to the number of slaves in'),\n",

It settled a standing border dispute between the two countries and was considered a triumph of American diplomacy. It came during the successful Spanish American wars of independence against Spain.\\n Florida had become a burden to Spain, which could not afford to send settlers or staff garrisons, so Madrid decided to cede the territory to the United States in exchange for settling the boundary dispute along the Sabine River in Spanish Texas. The treaty established the boundary of U.S. territory and claims through the Rocky Mountains and west to the Pacific Ocean, in exchange for Washington paying residents' claims against the Spanish government up to a total of $5 million Spanish dollars[7] (purchasing power equivalent to US$99,500,000 in 2023) and relinquishing the U.S. claims on parts of Spanish Texas west of the Sabine River and other Spanish areas, under the terms of the Louisiana Purchase.\\n The treaty remained in full effect for only 183 days: from February 22, 1821, to August 24, 1821, when Spanish military officials signed the Treaty of Córdoba acknowledging the independence of Mexico; Spain repudiated that treaty, but Mexico effectively took control of Spain's former colony. The Treaty of Limits between Mexico and the United States, signed in 1828 and effective in 1832, recognized the border defined by the Adams–Onís Treaty as the boundary between the two nations.\\n \\n History \\n [edit] The Adams–Onís Treaty was negotiated by John Quincy Adams, the Secretary of State under U.S. President James Monroe, and the Spanish minister plenipotentiary (diplomatic envoy) Luis de Onís y González-Vara, during the reign of King Ferdinand VII.[8]\\n \\n Florida \\n [edit]  West Florida East Florida  Spain had long rejected repeated American efforts to purchase Florida.

Spain had been exhausted by the Peninsular War (1807–1814) against Napoleon in Europe and needed to rebuild its credibility and presence in its colonies. Revolutionaries in Central America and South America had been waging wars of independence since 1810. Spain was unwilling to invest further in Florida, encroached on by American settlers, and it worried about the border between New Spain (a large area including today's Mexico, Central America, and much of the current U.S. western states) and the United States. With minor military presence in Florida, Spain was not able to restrain the Seminole warriors who routinely crossed the border and raided American villages and farms, as well as protected southern slave refugees from slave owners and traders of the southern United States.[9]\\n The United States from 1810 to 1813 annexed and then invaded most of West Florida (already independent as the Republic of West Florida west of the Pearl River) up to the Perdido River (modern border river between the states of Alabama and Florida), claiming that the Louisiana Purchase covered West Florida also.[10] General James Wilkinson invaded and occupied Mobile during the War of 1812 and the Spanish never returned to West Florida west of the Perdido River.\\n The State of Muskogee (1799–1803) demonstrated Spain's inability to control the interior of East Florida, at least de facto; the Spanish presence had been reduced to the capital (San Agustín) and other coastal cities, while the interior belonged to the Seminole nation.[citation needed]\\n While fighting escaped African-American slaves, outlaws, and Native Americans in U.S.-controlled Georgia during the First Seminole War, American General Andrew Jackson had pursued them into Spanish Florida. He built Fort Scott, at the southern border of Georgia (i.e., the U.S.), and used it to destroy the Negro Fort in northwest Florida, whose existence was perceived as an intolerably disruptive risk by Georgia plantation owners.\\n To stop the Seminole based in East Florida from raiding Georgia settlements and offering havens for runaway slaves, the U.S. Army led increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish territory. This included the 1817–1818 campaign by Andrew Jackson that became known as the First Seminole War, after which the U.S. effectively seized control of Florida; albeit for purposes of lawful government and administration in Georgia and not for the outright annexation of territory for the U.S. Adams said the U.S. had to take\"),\n",

Some of President Monroe\\'s cabinet demanded Jackson\\'s immediate dismissal for invading Florida, but Adams realized that his success had given the U.S. a favorable diplomatic position. Adams was able to negotiate very favorable terms.[9]\\n \\n Louisiana \\n [edit]  Mississippi River Basin In 1521, the Spanish Empire created the Virreinato de Nueva España (Viceroyalty of New Spain) to govern its conquests in the Caribbean, North America, and later the Pacific Ocean. In 1682, La Salle claimed Louisiana for France.[13] For the Spanish Empire, this was an intrusion into the northeastern frontier of New Spain. In 1691, Spain created the Province of Tejas in an attempt to inhibit French settlement west of the Mississippi River. Fearing the loss of his American territories in the Seven Years\\' War, King Louis XV of France ceded Louisiana to King Charles III of Spain with the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1762. The Treaty of Paris of 1763 split Louisiana with the portion east of the Mississippi River (except for Île d\\'Orléans) becoming a part of British North America and the portion west of the river becoming the District of Louisiana within New Spain. This eliminated the French threat, and the Spanish provinces of Luisiana, Tejas, and Santa Fe de Nuevo México coexisted with only loosely defined borders. In 1800, French First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte forced King Charles IV of Spain to cede Louisiana to France with the secret Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. Spain continued to administer Louisiana until 1802 when Spain publicly transferred the district to France. The following year, Napoleon sold the territory to the United States to raise money for his military campaigns.[14]\\n The United States and the Spanish Empire disagreed over the territorial boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.

To the west of New Orleans, the United States assumed the French claim to all land east and north of either the Sabine River[15] or the Rio Grande.[16][17][notes 1] Spain maintained that all land west of the Calcasieu River and south of the Arkansas River belonged to Tejas and Santa Fe de Nuevo México.[18][19][20]\\n \\n Oregon Country \\n [edit]  Columbia River Basin The British government claimed the region west of the Continental Divide between the undefined borders of Alta California and Russian Alaska on the basis of (1) the third voyage of James Cook in 1778, (2) the Vancouver Expedition in 1791–1795, (3) the solo journey of Alexander Mackenzie to the North Bentinck Arm[notes 2] in 1792–1793, and (4) the exploration of David Thompson in 1807–1812. The Third Nootka Convention of 1794 stipulated that both the British and Spanish would abandon any settlements they had in the Nootka Sound.[21]\\n The United States claimed essentially the same region on the basis of (1) the voyage of Robert Gray up the Columbia River in 1792, (2) the United States Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804–1806, and (3) the establishment of Fort Astoria[notes 3] on the Columbia River in 1811. On 20 October 1818, the Anglo-American Convention of 1818 was signed setting the border between British North America and the United States east of the Continental Divide along the 49th parallel north and calling for joint Anglo-American occupancy west of the Great Divide. The Anglo-American Convention ignored the Nootka Convention of 1794 which gave Spain joint rights in the region. The convention also ignored Russian settlements in the region. The U.S. government referred to this region as the Oregon Country, while the British government referred to the region as the Columbia District.[22]\\n \\n Russian America \\n [edit]  Russian claims in the Americas  On 16 July 1741, the crew of the Imperial Russian Navy ship Saint Peter (Святой Пётр), captained by Vitus Bering, sighted Mount Saint Elias,[notes 4] the fourth-highest summit in North America.

By 1812, the Russian Empire claimed Alaska and the Pacific Coast of North America as far south as the Russian settlement of Fortress Ross,[notes 5] only 105 kilometers (65 miles) northwest of the Spain\\'s Presidio Real de San Francisco.[23]\\n \\n New Spain \\n [edit]    The Spanish Empire claimed all lands west of the Continental Divide throughout the Americas.[notes 6] Between 1774 and 1779, King Charles III of Spain ordered three naval expeditions north along the Pacific Coast to assert Spain\\'s territorial claims. In July 1774, Juan José Pérez Hernández reached latitude 54°40′ north off the northwestern tip of Langara Island before being forced to turn south. On 15 August 1775, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra reached the latitude 59°0′ before returning south. On 23 July 1779, Ignacio de Arteaga y Bazán and Bodega y Quadra reached Puerto de Santiago on Isla de la Magdalena (now Port Etches on Hinchinbrook Island)[notes 7] where they held a formal possession ceremony commemorating Saint James, the patron saint of Spain. This marked the northernmost Spanish exploration in the Pacific Ocean.\\n Between 1788 and 1793, Spain launched several more expeditions north of Alta California. On 24 June 1789, Esteban José Martínez Fernández y Martínez de la Sierra established the Spanish colony of Santa Cruz de Nuca[notes 8] on the northwest coast of Vancouver Island. Asserting Spain\\'s claim of exclusive sovereignty and navigation rights, Martínez seized several ships in Nootka Sound provoking the Nootka Crisis with Great Britain. In negotiations to resolve the crisis, Spain claimed that its Nootka Territory extended north from Alta California to the 61st parallel north and from the Continental Divide west to the 147th meridian west.[citation needed] On 11 January 1794, the Spanish and British governments signed the Third Nootka Convention which called for the abandonment of all permanent settlements on Nootka Sound. Santa Cruz de Nuca was formally abandoned on 28 March 1795. The convention also stipulated that both nations were free to use Nootka Sound as a port and erect temporary structures, but, \"neither ... shall form any permanent establishment in the said'),\n",

In the south, the disputed region between the Calcasieu River and the Sabine River encompassed Los Adaes, the first capital of Spanish Texas. The region between the Calcasieu and Sabine rivers became a lawless no man\\'s land. The United States saw great potential in these western lands, and hoped to settle their borders. Spain, seeing the end of New Spain, hoped to employ its territorial claims before it would be forced to grant Mexico its independence (later in 1821). Spain hoped to regain much of its territory after the regional demands for independence subsided.[citation needed]\\n \\n Details of the treaty \\n [edit]  The treaty, consisting of 16 articles[24] was signed in Adams\\' State Department office at Washington,[25] on February 22, 1819, by John Quincy Adams, U.S. Secretary of State, and Luis de Onís, Spanish minister. Ratification was postponed for two years, because Spain wanted to use the treaty as an incentive to keep the United States from giving diplomatic support to the revolutionaries in South America. On February 24, the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty unanimously,[26] but because of Spain\\'s stalling, a new ratification was necessary and this time there were objections. Henry Clay and other Western spokesmen demanded that Spain also give up Texas.

Spain also ceded to the U.S. its claims to the Oregon Country, under Article 3.\\n The U.S. did not pay Spain for Florida, but instead agreed to pay the legal claims of American citizens against Spain, to a maximum of $5 million, under Article 11.[notes 10] Under Article 12, Pinckney's Treaty of 1795 between the U.S. and Spain was to remain in force. Under Article 15, Spanish goods received exclusive most-favored-nation privileges in the ports at Pensacola and St. Augustine for twelve years.\\n Under Article 2, the U.S. received ownership of Spanish Florida.

Many historians consider the Treaty to be a great achievement for the U.S., as time validated Adams\\'s vision that it would allow the U.S. to open trade with the Orient across the Pacific.[28]\\n Informally this new border has been called the \"Step Boundary\",[citation needed] although the step-like shape of the boundary was not apparent for several decades—the source of the Arkansas, believed to be near the 42nd parallel north, was not known until John C. Frémont located it in the 1840s, hundreds of miles south of the 42nd parallel.\\n \\n Implementation \\n [edit] Washington set up a commission, 1821 to 1824, that handled American claims against Spain. Many notable lawyers, including Daniel Webster and William Wirt, represented claimants before the commission. Dr. Tobias Watkins served as secretary.[29] During its term, the commission examined 1,859 claims arising from over 720 spoliation incidents, and distributed the $5 million in a basically fair manner.[30]\\nThe treaty reduced tensions with Spain (and after 1821 Mexico), and allowed budget cutters in Congress to reduce the army budget and reject the plans to modernize and expand the army proposed by Secretary of War John C. Calhoun.[citation needed] The treaty was honored by both sides, although inaccurate maps from the treaty meant that the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma remained unclear for most of the 19th century.\\n \\n Later developments \\n [edit]  The treaty was ratified by Spain in 1820, and by the United States in 1821 (during the time that Spain and Mexico were engaged in the prolonged Mexican War of Independence). Luis de Onís published a 152-page memoir on the diplomatic negotiation in 1820, which was translated from Spanish to English by'),\n",

While Mexico was not initially a party to the Adams–Onís Treaty, in 1831 Mexico ratified the treaty by agreeing to the 1828 Treaty of Limits with the U.S.[32]\\n With the Russo-American Treaty of 1824, the Russian Empire ceded its claims south of parallel 54°40′ north to the United States. With the Treaty of Saint Petersburg in 1825, Russia set the southern border of Alaska on the same parallel in exchange for the Russian right to trade south of that border and the British right to navigate north of that border. This set the absolute limits of the Oregon Country/Columbia District between the 42nd parallel north and the parallel 54°40′ north west of the Continental Divide.\\n By the mid-1830s, a controversy developed regarding the border with Texas, during which the United States demonstrated that the Sabine and Neches rivers had been switched on maps, moving the frontier in favor of Mexico. As a consequence, the eastern boundary of Texas was not firmly established until the independence of the Republic of Texas in 1836. It was not agreed upon by the United States and Mexico until the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, which concluded the Mexican–American War. That treaty also formalized the cession by Mexico of Alta California and today's American Southwest, except for the territory of the later Gadsden Purchase of 1854.[33]\\n  Territorial expansion of the United States Another dispute occurred after Texas joined the Union. The treaty stated that the boundary between the French claims on the north and the Spanish claims on the south was Rio Roxo de Natchitoches (Red River) until it reached the 100th meridian, as noted on the John Melish map of 1818. But, the 100th meridian on the Melish map was marked some 90 miles (140\\xa0km) east of the true 100th meridian, and the Red River forked about 50 miles (80\\xa0km) east of the 100th meridian. Texas claimed the land south of the North Fork, and the United States claimed the land north of the South Fork (later called the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River). In 1860, Texas organized the area as\"),\n",

In 1860, Texas organized the area as Greer County. The matter was not settled until a United States Supreme Court ruling in 1896 upheld federal claims to the territory, after which it was added to the Oklahoma Territory.[34]\\n The treaty gave rise to a later border dispute between the states of Oregon and California, which remains unresolved. Upon statehood in 1850, California established the 42nd parallel as its constitutional de jure border as it had existed since 1819 when the territory was part of Spanish Mexico. In an 1868–1870 border survey following the admission of Oregon as a state, errors were made in demarcating and marking the Oregon-California border, creating a dispute that continues to this day.[35][36][37][38]\\n In 2020, a hoax appeared in Spain according to which, in 2055, the Adams–Onís Treaty would expire and Florida would be returned to Spain by the United States, which is false.[39][40]\\n \\n See also \\n [edit] History portal Geography portal United States portal Mexico portal Spain portal List of treaties Spain–United States relations Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest Stephen H.

Most commonly, the criteria for evaluating the degree of economic development are the gross domestic product (GDP), gross national product (GNP), the per capita income, level of industrialization, amount of widespread infrastructure and general standard of living.[5] Which criteria are to be used and which countries can be classified as being developed are subjects of debate. Different definitions of developed countries are provided by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank; moreover, HDI ranking is used to reflect the composite index of life expectancy, education, and income per capita. In 2023, 40 countries fit all four criteria, while an additional 19 countries fit three out of four.\\n Developed countries have generally more advanced post-industrial economies, meaning the service sector provides more wealth than the industrial sector. They are contrasted with developing countries, which are in the process of industrialisation or are pre-industrial and almost entirely agrarian, some of which might fall into the category of Least Developed Countries. As of 2023[update], advanced economies comprise 57.3% of global GDP based on nominal values and 41.1% of global GDP based on purchasing-power parity (PPP) according to the IMF.[6]\\n \\n Definition and criteria \\n [edit]  [7] [8] Economic criteria have tended to dominate discussions. One such criterion is the income per capita; countries with the high gross domestic product (GDP) per capita would thus be described as developed countries. Another economic criterion is industrialisation; countries in which the tertiary and quaternary sectors of industry dominate would thus be described as developed. More recently, another measure, the Human Development Index (HDI), which combines an economic measure, national income, with other measures, indices for life expectancy and education has become prominent. This criterion would define developed countries as those with a very high (HDI) rating. The index, however, does not take into account several factors, such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country.'),\n",

This situation tends to lower the ranking of some of the most advanced countries, such as the G7 members and others.[9][10]\\n According to the United Nations Statistics Division:\\n There is no established convention for the designation of \"developed\" and \"developing\" countries or areas in the United Nations system.[11] And it notes that:\\n The designations \"developed\" and \"developing\" are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process.[12] Nevertheless, the UN Trade and Development considers that this categorization can continue to be applied:\\n The developed economies broadly comprise Northern America and Europe, Israel, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, and New Zealand.[7] \\n Similar terms \\n [edit] Global North and Global South Terms linked to the concept developed country include \"advanced country\", \"industrialized country\", \"more developed country\" (MDC), \"more economically developed country\" (MEDC), \"Global North country\", \"first world country\", and \"post-industrial country\". The term industrialized country may be somewhat ambiguous, as industrialisation is an ongoing process that is hard to define. The first industrialized country was the United Kingdom, followed by Belgium. Later it spread further to Germany, United States, France and other Western European countries. According to some economists such as Jeffrey Sachs, however, the current divide between the developed and developing world is largely a phenomenon of the 20th century.[13]\\n Mathis Wackernagel calls the binary labeling of countries as \"neither descriptive nor explanatory. It is merely a thoughtless and destructive endorsement of GDP fetish. In reality, there are not two types of countries, but over 200 countries, all faced with the same laws of nature, yet each with unique features.\"[14]\\n A 2021 analysis proposes the term emerged to describe markets, economies, or countries that have graduated from emerging market status, but have not yet reached the level equivalent to developed countries.[15] Multinational corporations from these emerging markets present unique patterns of overseas expansion and knowledge acquisition from foreign countries.\\n \\n Economy lists by various criteria \\n [edit] \\n Human Development Index (HDI) \\n [edit] Human Development Index List of countries by Human Development Index  \\xa0\\xa0Very high \\xa0\\xa0High \\xa0\\xa0Medium \\xa0\\xa0Low \\xa0\\xa0No data '),\n",

While Frenchmen Auguste and Louis Lumière are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema,[5] American cinema soon came to be a dominant force in the emerging industry. With more than 600 English-language films released on average every year as of 2017[update], it produced the fourth-largest number of films of any national cinema, after India, Japan, and China.[6] While the national cinemas of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand also produce films in the same language, they are not part of the Hollywood system. Because of this, Hollywood has also been considered a transnational cinema,[7] and has produced multiple language versions of some titles, often in Spanish or French. Contemporary Hollywood often outsources production to the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The major film studios of Hollywood are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world.[8][9]\\n Hollywood is considered to be the oldest film industry, being the place where the earliest film studios and production companies emerged. It is the birthplace of various genres of cinema[10]—among them comedy, drama, action, the musical, romance, horror, science fiction,[dubious – discuss] and epic—and has set the example for other national film industries.\\n In 1878, Eadweard Muybridge demonstrated the power of photography to capture motion. In 1894, the world's first commercial motion-picture exhibition was given in New York City, using Thomas Edison's kinetoscope.[11] In the following decades, the production of silent films greatly expanded, studios formed and migrated to California, and the films and stories they told became much longer. The United States produced the world's first sync-sound musical film, The Jazz Singer, in 1927,[12] and was at the forefront of sound-film development in the following decades.

Barnes The Great Train Robbery Western The first recorded instance of photographs capturing and reproducing motion was a series of photographs of a running horse by Eadweard Muybridge, which he took in Palo Alto, California, using a set of still cameras placed in a row. Muybridge\\'s accomplishment led inventors everywhere to attempt to make similar devices. In the United States, Thomas Edison was among the first to produce such a device, the kinetoscope.[citation needed]\\n  Harold Lloyd Safety Last! The history of cinema in the United States can trace its roots to the East Coast where, at one time, Fort Lee, New Jersey, was the motion-picture capital of America. The industry got its start at the end of the 19th century with the construction of Thomas Edison\\'s \"Black Maria\", the first motion-picture studio in West Orange, New Jersey. The cities and towns on the Hudson River and Hudson Palisades offered land at costs considerably less than New York City across the river and benefited greatly as a result of the phenomenal growth of the film industry at the turn of the 20th century.[14]\\n[15]\\n[16][17]\\n The industry began attracting both capital and innovative workforces. In 1907, when the Kalem Company began using Fort Lee as a location for filming in the area, other filmmakers quickly followed. In 1909, a forerunner of Universal Studios, the Champion Film Company, built the first studio.[18] Others quickly followed and either built new studios or leased facilities in Fort Lee. In the 1910s and 1920s, film companies such as the Independent Moving Pictures Company, Peerless Studios, The Solax Company, Éclair Studios, Goldwyn Picture Corporation, American Méliès (Star Films), World Film Company, Biograph Studios, Fox Film'),\n",

Such notables as Mary Pickford got their start at Biograph Studios.[19][20][21]\\n In New York, the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, which was built during the silent film era, was used by the Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields. The Edison Studios were located in the Bronx. Chelsea, Manhattan, was also frequently used. \\n Other Eastern cities, most notably Chicago and Cleveland, also served as early centers for film production.[22][23] \\n In the West, California was already quickly emerging as a major film production center. In Colorado, Denver was home to the Art-O-Graf film company, and Walt Disney's early Laugh-O-Gram animation studio was based in Kansas City, Missouri. \\n From 1908, Jacksonville, Florida's Motion picture industry saw more than 30 silent film companies establish studios in town, including  Kalem Studios, Metro Pictures (later MGM), Edison Studios, Majestic Films,[24] King Bee Film Company, Vim Comedy Company, Norman Studios, Gaumont Studios and the Lubin Manufacturing Company.\\n Picture City, Florida, was a planned site for a movie picture production center in the 1920s, but due to the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane, the idea collapsed and Picture City returned to its original name of Hobe Sound. \\n An attempt to establish a film production center in Detroit also proved unsuccessful.[25]\\n The film patents wars of the early 20th century helped the spread of film companies to other parts of the US, outside New York. Many filmmakers worked with equipment for which they did not own the rights to use. Therefore, filming in New York could be dangerous as it was close to Edison's company headquarters, and close to the agents who the company set out to seize cameras.\\n An alternative was Los Angeles, which had mild winters, a large selection of places to film, and most importantly, it was only 90 miles to the border of Mexico, in case they needed to run if Edison's enforcement agents found them. By 1912, most major film companies had set up production facilities in Southern California near or in Los Angeles because of the region's favorable year-round weather.[26]\\n \\n Rise of Hollywood \\n [edit] Hollywood,\"),\n",

W. Griffith was sent by the Biograph Company to the west coast with his acting troupe, consisting of actors Blanche Sweet, Lillian Gish, Mary Pickford, Lionel Barrymore and others. They started filming on a vacant lot near Georgia Street in downtown Los Angeles. While there, the company decided to explore new territories, traveling several miles north to Hollywood, a little village that was friendly and enjoyed the movie company filming there. Griffith then filmed the first movie ever shot in Hollywood, In Old California, a Biograph melodrama about California in the 19th century, when it belonged to Mexico. Griffith stayed there for months and made several films before returning to New York. Also in 1910, Selig Poly scope of Chicago established the first film studio in the Los Angeles area in Edendale[27] and the first studio in Hollywood opened in 1912.[30]:\\u200a447\\u200a After hearing about Griffith's success in Hollywood, in 1913, many movie-makers headed west to avoid the fees imposed by Thomas Edison, who owned patents on the movie-making process.[31] Nestor Studios of Bayonne, New Jersey, built the first studio in the Hollywood neighborhood in 1911.[dubious – discuss] Nestor Studios, owned by David and William Horsley, later merged with Universal Studios; and William Horsley's other company, Hollywood Film Laboratory, is now the oldest existing company in Hollywood, now called the Hollywood Digital Laboratory.

California's more hospitable and cost-effective climate led to the eventual shift of virtually all filmmaking to the West Coast by the 1930s. At the time, Thomas Edison owned almost all the patents relevant to motion picture production and movie producers on the East Coast acting independently of Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company were often sued or enjoined by Edison and his agents while movie makers working on the West Coast could work independently of Edison's control.[32]\\n  Hollywood Walk of Fame Hollywood Boulevard In Los Angeles, the studios and Hollywood grew. Before World War I, films were made in several American cities, but filmmakers tended to gravitate towards southern California as the industry developed. They were attracted by the warm climate and reliable sunlight, which made it possible to film their films outdoors year-round and by the varied scenery that was available.[citation needed] War damage contributed to the decline of the then-dominant European film industry, in favor of the United States, where infrastructure was still intact.[33] The stronger early public health response to the 1918 flu epidemic by Los Angeles[34] compared to other American cities reduced the number of cases there and resulted in a faster recovery, contributing to the increasing dominance of Hollywood over New York City.[33] During the pandemic, public health officials temporarily closed movie theaters in some jurisdictions, large studios suspended production for weeks at a time, and some actors came down with the flu. This caused major financial losses and severe difficulties for small studios, but the industry as a whole more than recovered during the Roaring Twenties.[35]\\n In the early 20th century, when the medium was new, many Jewish immigrants found employment in the US film industry. They were able to make their mark in a brand-new business: the exhibition of short films in storefront theaters called nickelodeons, after their admission price of a nickel (five cents). Within a few years, ambitious men like Samuel Goldwyn, William Fox, Carl Laemmle, Adolph Zukor, Louis B. Mayer, and the Warner Brothers (Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack) had switched to the production side of the business. Soon they were the heads of a new kind of enterprise: the movie studio.

They joined a homegrown supply of actors—lured west from the New York City stage after the introduction of sound films—to form one of the 20th century\\'s most remarkable growth industries. At motion pictures\\' height of popularity in the mid-1940s, the studios were cranking out a total of about 400 movies a year, seen by an audience of 90\\xa0million Americans per week.[36]\\n  Buster Keaton pork pie hat Sound also became widely used in Hollywood in the late 1920s.[37] After The Jazz Singer, the first film with synchronized voices was successfully released as a Vitaphone talkie in 1927, Hollywood film companies would respond to Warner Bros. and begin to use Vitaphone sound—which Warner Bros. owned until 1928—in future films. By May 1928, Electrical Research Product Incorporated (ERPI), a subsidiary of the Western Electric company, gained a monopoly over film sound distribution.[36]\\n A side effect of the \"talkies\" was that many actors who had made their careers in silent films suddenly found themselves out of work, as they often had bad voices or could not remember their lines. Meanwhile, in 1922, US politician Will H. Hays left politics and formed the movie studio boss organization known as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA).[38] The organization became the Motion Picture Association of America after Hays retired in 1945.\\n In the early times of talkies, American studios found that their sound productions were rejected in foreign-language markets and even among speakers of other dialects of English. The synchronization technology was still too primitive for dubbing. One of the solutions was creating parallel foreign-language versions of Hollywood films. Around 1930, the American companies[which?] opened a studio in Joinville-le-Pont, France, where the same sets and wardrobe and even mass scenes were used for different time-sharing crews.\\n Also, foreign unemployed actors, playwrights, and winners of photogenic contests were chosen and brought to Hollywood, where they shot parallel versions of the English-language films.

These parallel versions had a lower budget, were shot at night and were directed by second-line American directors who did not speak the foreign language. The Spanish-language crews included people like Luis Buñuel, Enrique Jardiel Poncela, Xavier Cugat, and Edgar Neville. The productions were not very successful in their intended markets, due to the following reasons:\\n  Brown Derby The lower budgets were apparent. Many theater actors had no previous experience in cinema. The original movies were often second-rate themselves since studios expected that the top productions would sell by themselves. The mix of foreign accents (Castilian, Mexican, and Chilean for example in the Spanish case) was odd for the audiences. Some markets lacked sound-equipped theaters. \\n Classical Hollywood cinema and the Golden Age of Hollywood \\n [edit] Classical Hollywood cinema  Classical Hollywood cinema \\u20091913–1962 Greta Garbo Humphrey Bogart Lauren Bacall Clark Gable Katharine Hepburn Fred Astaire Ginger Rogers Marlon Brando Marx Brothers Joan Crawford John Wayne James Stewart Buster Keaton Claudette Colbert Gene Kelly Burt Lancaster Judy Garland Gregory Peck Elizabeth Taylor Kirk Douglas Bette Davis Audrey Hepburn Jean Harlow Alfred Hitchcock John Ford Howard Hawks Grace Kelly Laurence Olivier Marlene Dietrich James Cagney Ava Gardner Cary Grant Ingrid Bergman Henry Fonda Marilyn Monroe James Dean Orson Welles Mae West William Holden Sophia Loren Vivien Leigh Joan Fontaine Gary Cooper Spencer Tracy Barbara Stanwyck Lillian Gish Tyrone Power Shirley Temple Janet Leigh Charlton Heston Rita Hayworth Mary Pickford Classical Hollywood cinema, or the Golden Age of Hollywood, is defined as a technical and narrative style characteristic of American cinema from 1913 to 1962, during which thousands of movies were issued from the Hollywood studios. The Classical style began to emerge in 1913, was accelerated in 1917 after the U.S. entered World War I, and finally solidified when the film The Jazz Singer was released in 1927, ending the silent film era and increasing box-office profits for the film industry by introducing sound to feature films.\\n Most Hollywood pictures adhered closely to a formula\\xa0– Western, slapstick comedy, musical, animated cartoon, biographical\\xa0– and the same creative teams often worked on films made by the same studio.

De Mille\\'s films were almost all made at Paramount, and director Henry King\\'s films were mostly made for 20th Century Fox.\\n At the same time, one could usually guess which studio made which film, largely because of the actors who appeared in it; MGM, for example, claimed it had contracted \"more stars than there are in heaven.\" Each studio had its own style and characteristic touches which made it possible to know this\\xa0– a trait that rarely exists today.\\n For example, To Have and Have Not (1944) is notable not only for the first pairing of actors Humphrey Bogart (1899–1957) and Lauren Bacall (1924–2014), but because it was written by two future winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature: Ernest Hemingway (1899–1961), the author of the novel on which the script was nominally based, and William Faulkner (1897–1962), who worked on the screen adaptation.\\n After The Jazz Singer was released in 1927, Warner Bros. gained huge success and were able to acquire their own string of movie theaters after purchasing Stanley Theaters and First National Productions in 1928. In contrast, Loews theaters owned MGM since forming in 1924, while the Fox Film Corporation owned the Fox Theatre. RKO (a 1928 merger between Keith-Orpheum Theaters and the Radio Corporation of America[39]) also responded to the Western Electric/ERPI monopoly over sound in films, and developed their own method, known as Photophone, to put sound in films.[36]\\n Paramount, which acquired Balaban and Katz in 1926, would answer to the success of Warner Bros. and RKO, and buy a number of theaters in the late 1920s as well, and would hold a monopoly on theaters in Detroit, Michigan.[40] By the 1930s, almost all of the first-run metropolitan theaters in the United States were owned by the Big Five studios—MGM, Paramount Pictures, RKO, Warner Bros., and 20th Century Fox.[41]\\n \\n Rise and decline of the studio system \\n [edit]  Motion picture companies operated under the studio system.

In 1937, Disney created the most successful film of its time, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.[45] This distinction was promptly topped in 1939 when Selznick International created what is still, when adjusted for inflation, the most successful film of all time in Gone with the Wind.[46]\\n Many film historians have remarked upon the many great works of cinema that emerged from this period of highly regimented filmmaking. One reason this was possible is that, with so many movies being made, not every one had to be a big hit.

Among the other films from the Golden Age period that are now considered to be classics: Casablanca, It\\'s a Wonderful Life, It Happened One Night, the original King Kong, Mutiny on the Bounty, Top Hat, City Lights, Red River, The Lady from Shanghai, Rear Window, On the Waterfront, Rebel Without a Cause, Some Like It Hot, and The Manchurian Candidate.\\n   Walt Disney seven dwarfs Snow White The studio system and the Golden Age of Hollywood succumbed to two forces that developed in the late 1940s:\\n a federal antitrust action that separated the production of films from their exhibition; and the advent of television. In 1938, Walt Disney\\'s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was released during a run of lackluster films from the major studios, and quickly became the highest grossing film released to that point. Embarrassingly for the studios, it was an independently produced animated film that did not feature any studio-employed stars.[47] This stoked already widespread frustration at the practice of block-booking, in which studios would only sell an entire year\\'s schedule of films at a time to theaters and use the lock-in to cover for releases of mediocre quality.\\n Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold—a noted \"trust buster\" of the Roosevelt administration—took this opportunity to initiate proceedings against the eight largest Hollywood studios in July 1938 for violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act.[48][49] The federal suit resulted in five of the eight studios (the \"Big Five\": Warner Bros., MGM, Fox, RKO and Paramount) reaching a compromise with Arnold in October 1940 and signing a consent decree agreeing to, within three years:\\n Eliminate the block-booking of short film subjects, in an arrangement known as \"one shot\", or \"full force\" block-booking'),\n",

No longer engage in blind buying (or the buying of films by theater districts without seeing films beforehand) and instead have trade-showing, in which all 31 theater districts in the US would see films every two weeks before showing movies in theaters. Set up an administration board in each theater district to enforce these requirements.[48]  Humphrey Bogart Ingrid Bergman Casablanca The \"Little Three\" (Universal Studios, United Artists, and Columbia Pictures), who did not own any theaters, refused to participate in the consent decree.[48][49] A number of independent film producers were also unhappy with the compromise and formed a union known as the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers and sued Paramount for the monopoly they still had over the Detroit Theaters—as Paramount was also gaining dominance through actors like Bob Hope, Paulette Goddard, Veronica Lake, Betty Hutton, crooner Bing Crosby, Alan Ladd, and longtime actor for studio Gary Cooper too- by 1942. The Big Five studios did not meet the requirements of the Consent of Decree during WWII, without major consequence, but after the war ended they joined Paramount as defendants in the Hollywood antitrust case, as did the Little Three studios.[50]\\n The United States Supreme Court eventually ruled in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. that the major studios ownership of theaters and film distribution was a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. As a result, the studios began to release actors and technical staff from their contracts with the studios. This changed the paradigm of film making by the major Hollywood studios, as each could have an entirely different cast and creative team.\\n The decision resulted in the gradual loss of the characteristics which made Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios, Columbia Pictures, RKO Pictures, and 20th Century Fox films immediately identifiable. Certain movie people, such as Cecil B. DeMille, either remained contract artists until the end of their careers or used the same creative teams on their films so that a DeMille film still looked like one whether it was made in 1932 or 1956.\\n \\n New Hollywood and post-classical cinema \\n [edit] New Hollywood  Steven Spielberg DreamWorks Studios Post-classical cinema is the changing methods of storytelling in the New Hollywood.

It has been argued that new approaches to drama and characterization played upon audience expectations acquired in the classical period: chronology may be scrambled, storylines may feature \"twist endings\", and lines between the antagonist and protagonist may be blurred. The roots of post-classical storytelling may be seen in film noir, in Rebel Without a Cause (1955), and in Hitchcock\\'s storyline-shattering Psycho.\\n The New Hollywood is the emergence of a new generation of film school-trained directors who had absorbed the techniques developed in Europe in the 1960s as a result of the French New Wave; the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde marked the beginning of American cinema rebounding as well, as a new generation of films would afterwards gain success at the box offices as well.[51] Filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Brian De Palma, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, Roman Polanski, and William Friedkin came to produce fare that paid homage to the history of film and developed upon existing genres and techniques. Inaugurated by the 1969 release of Andy Warhol\\'s Blue Movie, the phenomenon of adult erotic films being publicly discussed by celebrities (like Johnny Carson and Bob Hope),[52] and taken seriously by critics (like Roger Ebert),[53][54] a development referred to, by Ralph Blumenthal of The New York Times, as \"porno chic\", and later known as the Golden Age of Porn, began, for the first time, in modern American culture.[52][55][56] According to award-winning author Toni Bentley, Radley Metzger\\'s 1976 film The Opening of Misty Beethoven, based on the play Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw (and its derivative, My Fair Lady), and due to attaining a mainstream level in storyline and sets,[57] is considered the \"crown jewel\" of this \\'Golden Age\\'.[58][59]\\n At the height of his fame in the early 1970s, Charles Bronson was the world\\'s No. 1 box office attraction, commanding $1 million per film.[60] In the 1970s, the films of New Hollywood filmmakers were often both critically acclaimed and commercially successful.

Dick Tracy (1990) became the first 35 mm feature film with a digital soundtrack. Batman Returns (1992) was the first film to make use of the Dolby Digital six-channel stereo sound that has since become the industry standard. Computer-generated imagery was greatly facilitated when it became possible to transfer film images into a computer and manipulate them digitally. The possibilities became apparent in director James Cameron\\'s Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), in images of the shape-changing character T-1000. Computer graphics or CG advanced to a point where Jurassic Park (1993) was able to use the techniques to create realistic looking animals. Jackpot (2001) became the first film that was shot entirely in digital.[64] In the film Titanic, Cameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects with his film, and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology which the director pioneered while working on The Abyss and Terminator 2: Judgment Day.

The Big Six companies all enjoyed a period of expansion in the 1990s. They each developed different ways to adjust to rising costs in the film industry, especially the rising salaries of movie stars, driven by powerful agents. The biggest stars like Sylvester Stallone, Russell Crowe, Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sandra Bullock, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mel Gibson, Kevin Bacon, and Julia Roberts received between $15–$20\\xa0million per film and in some cases were even given a share of the film\\'s profits.[64]\\n Screenwriters on the other hand were generally paid less than the top actors or directors, usually under $1\\xa0million per film. However, the single largest factor driving rising costs was special effects.

Pictures announced their decision to simultaneously release its slate of 2021 films in both theaters and its streaming site HBO Max for a period of one month in order to maximize viewership.[83] The move was vehemently criticized by various industry figures, many of whom were reportedly uninformed of the decision before the announcement and felt deceived by the studio.[84]\\n 2019 onwards has seen the rise of American streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, and Apple TV+, which came to rival traditional cinema.[85][86] Industry commentators have noted the increasing treatment of films as \"content\" by corporations that correlate with the increased popularity of streaming platforms.[87] This involves the blurring of boundaries between films, television and other forms of media as more people consume them together in a variety of ways, with individual films defined more by their brand identity and commercial potential rather than their medium, stories and artistry.[85][88] Critic Matt Zoller Seitz has described the release of Avengers: Endgame in 2019 as \"represent[ing] the decisive defeat of \\'cinema\\' by \\'content\\'\" due to its grand success as a \"piece of entertainment\" defined by the Marvel brand that culminates a series of blockbuster films that has traits of serial television.[85]\\n  Tom Cruise Stade de France Hollywood Sign Games to Los Angeles closing ceremony The films Space Jam'),\n",

The last moguls of Hollywood were gone, and younger, newer executives and producers began pushing more liberal ideas.[citation needed]\\n Celebrities and money attracted politicians into the high-class, glittering Hollywood lifestyle. As Ron Brownstein wrote in his book The Power and the Glitter, television in the 1970s and 1980s was an enormously important new media in politics and Hollywood helped in that media with actors making speeches on their political beliefs, like Jane Fonda against the Vietnam War.[105] Despite most celebrities and producers being left-leaning and tending to support the Democratic Party,[106][107] this era produced some Republican actors and producers such as Clint Eastwood and Jerry Bruckheimer. Support groups such as the Friends of Abe were set up to support conservative causes in Hollywood, which is perceived as biased against conservatives.[108] Former actor Ronald Reagan became governor of California and subsequently became the 40th president of the United States.

This includes prioritizing sympathetic portrayals of Chinese characters in movies, such as changing the villains in Red Dawn from Chinese to North Koreans.[114] Due to many topics forbidden in China, such as Dalai Lama and Winnie-the-Pooh being involved in the South Park\\'s episode \"Band in China\", South Park was entirely banned in China after the episode\\'s broadcast.[115] The 2018 film Christopher Robin, the new Winnie-the-Pooh movie, was denied a Chinese release.[115]\\n Although Tibet was previously a cause célèbre in Hollywood, featuring in films including Kundun and Seven Years in Tibet, in the 21st century this is no longer the case.[116] In 2016, Marvel Entertainment attracted criticism for its decision to cast Tilda Swinton as \"The Ancient One\" in the film adaptation Doctor Strange, using a white woman to play a traditionally Tibetan character.[117] Actor and high-profile Tibet supporter Richard Gere stated that he was no longer welcome to participate in mainstream Hollywood films after criticizing the Chinese government and calling for a boycott of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.[116][118]\\n \\n Historic examples \\n [edit] Hollywood also self-censored any negative depictions of Nazis for most of the 1930s in order to maintain access to German audiences.[119] Around that time economic censorship resulted in the self-censoring of content to please the group wielding their economic influence.[119] The Hays Code was an industry-led effort from 1930–1967 to strict self-censorship in order to appease religious objections to certain content and stave off any government censorship that could have resulted.[119]\\n \\n Relationship with'),\n",

It was difficult to satisfy the huge demand for films created by the nickelodeon boom. Motion Picture Patents Company members such as Edison Studios, also sought to limit competition from French, Italian, and other imported films. Exporting films, then, became lucrative to these companies. Vitagraph Studios was the first American company to open its own distribution offices in Europe, establishing a branch in London in 1906, and a second branch in Paris shortly after.[126]\\n Other American companies were moving into foreign markets as well, and American distribution abroad continued to expand until the mid-1920s. Originally, a majority of companies sold their films indirectly. However, since they were inexperienced in overseas trading, they simply sold the foreign rights to their films to foreign distribution firms or export agents. Gradually, London became a center for the international circulation of US films.[126]\\n  Dolby Theatre Many British companies made a profit by acting as the agents for this business, and by doing so, they weakened British production by turning over a large share of the UK market to American films. By 1911, approximately 60 to 70 percent of films imported into Great Britain were American. The United States was also doing well in Germany, Australia, and New Zealand.[126]\\n More recently, as globalization has started to intensify, and the United States government has been actively promoting free trade agendas and trade on cultural products, Hollywood has become a worldwide'),\n",

The success on Hollywood export markets can be known not only from the boom of American multinational media corporations across the globe but also from the unique ability to make big-budget films that appeal powerfully to popular tastes in many different cultures.[127]\\n With globalization, movie production has been clustered in Hollywood for several reasons: the United States has the largest single home market in dollar terms, entertaining and highly visible Hollywood movies have global appeal, and the role of English as a universal language contributes to compensating for higher fixed costs of production.\\n Hollywood has moved more deeply into Chinese markets, although influenced by China\\'s censorship. Films made in China are censored, strictly avoiding themes like \"ghosts, violence, murder, horror, and demons.\" Such plot elements risk being cut. Hollywood has had to make \"approved\" films, corresponding to official Chinese standards, but with aesthetic standards sacrificed to box office profits.

According to Charles Ramírez Berg, third wave films \"do not accentuate Chicano oppression or resistance; ethnicity in these films exists as one fact of several that shape characters\\' lives and stamps their personalities.\"[145] Filmmakers like Edward James Olmos and Robert Rodriguez were able to represent the Hispanic and Latino American experience like none had on screen before, and actors like Hilary Swank, Jordana Brewster, Jessica Alba, Camilla Belle, Al Madrigal, Alexis Bledel, Sofía Vergara, Ana de Armas, and Rachel Zegler have become successful. In the last decade, minority filmmakers like Chris Weitz, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, and Patricia Riggen have been given applier[spelling?] narratives.

In the film, Chiron is placed in this divide as a black gay man and alters his presentation of masculinity as a strategy to avoid ridicule because homosexuality is viewed as incompatible with black masculine expectations. As young kids, Kevin hides his sexuality in order to avoid being singled out like Chiron is. As Chiron grows older, he recognizes the need to conform to a heteronormative ideal of black masculinity in order to avoid abuse and homophobia. As an adult, Chiron chooses to embrace the stereotypical black male gender performance by becoming muscular and a drug dealer.[147]\\n  According to Korean American actor Daniel Dae Kim, Asian and Asian American men \"have been portrayed as inscrutable villains and asexualized kind of eunuchs.\"[143] The Media Action Network for Asian Americans accused the director and studio of Aloha of whitewashing the cast of the film, and the director, Cameron Crowe, apologized about Emma Stone being miscast as a character who is meant to be of one quarter Chinese and one quarter Hawaiian descent.[149][150][151] Throughout the 20th century, acting roles in film were relatively few, and many available roles were narrow characters. In the 21st century, young Asian American comedians and filmmakers have found an outlet on YouTube allowing them to gain a strong and loyal fanbase among their fellow Asian Americans.[152] Although more recently the film Crazy Rich Asians has been lauded in the United States for featuring a predominantly Asian cast,[153] it was criticized elsewhere for casting biracial and non-Chinese actors as ethnically Chinese characters. The film Always Be My Maybe was lauded for taking familiar rom-com beats and cleverly layering in smart social commentary.[154]\\n Before the September 11 attacks, Arabs and Arab Americans were often portrayed as terrorists.[143] The decision to hire Naomi Scott, in the film Aladdin, the daughter of an English father and a Gujarati Ugandan-Indian mother, to play the lead of Jasmine, also drew criticism,'),\n",

Disney responded to the controversy saying, \"Diversity of our cast and background performers was a requirement and only in a handful of instances when it was a matter of specialty skills, safety and control (special effects rigs, stunt performers and handling of animals) were crew made up to blend in.\"[156][157]\\n \\n Working conditions \\n [edit] List of Hollywood strikes  New Beverly Cinema Hollywood\\'s work flow is unique in that much of its work force does not report to the same factory each day, nor follow the same routine from day to day, but films at distant locations around the world, with a schedule dictated by the scenes being filmed rather than what makes the most sense for productivity. For instance, an urban film shot entirely on location at night would require the bulk of its crews to work a graveyard shift, while a situational comedy series that shoots primarily on stage with only one or two days a week on location would follow a more traditional work schedule. Westerns are often shot in desert locations far from the homes of the crew in areas with limited hotels that necessitate long drives before and after a shooting day, which take advantage of as many hours of sunlight available, ultimately requiring workers to put in 16 or 17 hours a day from the time they leave their home to the time they return.[158][159]\\n While the role of labor in America has waned in many parts of the country, the unions have maintained a firm grip in Hollywood since their start during Great Depression when workers would line up outside the thriving movie studios looking for the only job in town. Terrible conditions awaited those workers as the studios exploited the eager workforce with meager pay and the ever present threat of the hundreds of others waiting just outside the gates to take their place if they voiced any complaints.[160]\\n Due to the casual nature of employment in Hollywood, it is only through collective bargaining can individual workers express their rights to minimum wage guarantees and access to pension and health plans that carry over from'),\n",

The 150,000 member-strong International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) represents most of the crafts, such as the grips, electricians, and camera people, as well as editors, sound engineers, and hair & make-up artists. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) is the next largest group representing some 130,000 actors and performers, the Directors Guild of America (DGA) represents the directors and production managers, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) representing writers, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) represents the drivers.[162][163]\\n The unions and guilds serve as the collective bargaining unit for their membership, negotiating on regular intervals (most currently on 3 year contracts) with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), a trade alliance representing the film studios and television networks that hire the crews to create their content.\\n While the relationship between labor and management has generally been amicable over the years, working together with the state to develop safe protocols to continue working during COVID-19 and lobbying together in favor of tax incentives, contract negotiations have been known to get contentious over changes in the industry and as a response to rising income inequality. The relationship even turned bloody in 1945 as a six-month strike by set decorators turned into a bloody melee on a sweltering October day between strikers, scabs, strikebreakers, and studio security.[164][165][166][167]\\n \\n See also \\n [edit] Film portal United States portal African American cinema Category:Documentary films about Hollywood, Los Angeles Category:Documentary films about the cinema of the United States Category:Films about Hollywood, Los Angeles Lists of American films American comedy films American Film Institute History of animation in the United States List of films in the public domain in the United States Motion Picture Association of America film rating system National Film Registry List of cinema of the world Photography in the United States of America\\nCinema of North America \\n References \\n [edit] ^ a b .mw-parser-output cite.'),\n",

A number of his buildings, including his private residence in Santa Monica, California, have become world-renowned attractions.\\n His works are considered among the most important of contemporary architecture in the 2010 World Architecture Survey, leading Vanity Fair to call him \"the most important architect of our age\".[2] He is also the designer of the National Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial.[3]\\n Gehry is known for his postmodern designs and use of bold, unconventional forms and materials. His most famous works include the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain, the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, and the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris. These buildings are characterized by their sculptural, often undulating exteriors and innovative use of materials such as titanium and stainless steel.\\n Born in Toronto, Gehry moved to Los Angeles in 1947 and established his architectural practice there in 1962. He rose to prominence in the 1970s with his distinctive style that blended everyday materials with complex, dynamic structures. Gehry\\'s approach to architecture has been described as deconstructivist, though he himself resists categorization.\\n Throughout his career, Gehry has received numerous awards and honors, including the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1989, considered the field\\'s highest honor. He has also been awarded the National Medal of Arts and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the United States. Gehry\\'s influence extends beyond architecture; he has designed furniture, jewelry, and liquor bottles.\\n \\n Early life \\n [edit]  Santa Monica Gehry was born Frank Owen Goldberg[4] on February 28, 1929, in Toronto, Ontario,[5] to parents Sadie Thelma (née Kaplanski/Caplan) and Irving Goldberg.[6] His father was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Russian Jewish parents, and his mother was a Polish Jewish immigrant born in Łódź.[7][8][9] A creative child, he was encouraged by his grandmother, Leah Caplan,[10] with whom he built little cities out of scraps of wood.[11] With these scraps from her husband\\'s hardware store, she entertained him for hours, building imaginary houses and futuristic cities on the living room floor.[6]\\n Gehry\\'s use of corrugated steel, chain-link fencing, unpainted ply'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Frank_Gehry.txt'}, page_content=']\\n Gehry\\'s use of corrugated steel, chain-link fencing, unpainted plywood, and other utilitarian or \"everyday\" materials was partly inspired by spending Saturday mornings at his grandfather\\'s hardware store. He spent time drawing with his father, and his mother introduced him to the world of art. \"So the creative genes were there\", Gehry says. \"But my father thought I was a dreamer, I wasn\\'t gonna amount to anything. It was my mother who thought I was just reticent to do things. She would push me.\"[12]\\n He was given the Hebrew name \"Ephraim\" by his grandfather, but used it only at his bar mitzvah.[13]\\n \\n Education \\n [edit] In 1947, Gehry\\'s family immigrated to the United States, settling in California. He got a job driving a delivery truck and studied at Los Angeles City College. He went on to graduate from the University of Southern California\\'s School of Architecture. During that time, he became a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi.[14]\\n According to Gehry, \"I was a truck driver in L.A., going to City College, and I tried radio announcing, which I wasn\\'t very good at. I tried chemical engineering, which I wasn\\'t very good at and didn\\'t like, and then I remembered. You know, somehow I just started wracking my brain about, \\'What do I like?\\' Where was I? What made me excited? And I remembered art, that I loved going to museums and I loved looking at paintings, loved listening to music. Those things came from my mother, who took me to concerts and museums. I remembered Grandma and the blocks, and just on a hunch, I tried some architecture classes.\"[15] Gehry graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture degree from the University of Southern California  in 1954.[16]\\n He then spent time away from architecture in numerous other jobs, including service in the United States Army.[11] In the fall of 1956, he moved his family to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he studied city planning at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. He left before completing the program, disheartened and \"underwhelmed\".[17] His progressive ideas about socially responsible architecture were under-realized,[clarification needed] and the final straw occurred when he sat in on a discussion of one professor\\'s \"secret project in progress\"—a palace that he was designing for right-wing Cuban dictator'),\n",

In 1957, at age 28, he was given the chance to design his first private residence with friend and old classmate Greg Walsh. Construction was done by another neighbor across the street from his wife\\'s family, Charlie Sockler. Built in Idyllwild, California for his wife Anita\\'s family neighbor Melvin David, the over 2,000\\xa0sq\\xa0ft (190\\xa0m2) \"David Cabin\"[18] shows features that were to become synonymous with Gehry\\'s later work, including beams protruding from the exterior sides, vertical-grain douglas fir detail, and exposed unfinished ceiling beams. It also shows strong Asian influences, stemming from his earliest inspirations, such as the Shosoin treasure house in Nara, Japan.\\n In 1961, Gehry moved to Paris, where he worked for architect Andre Remondet.[19] In 1962, he established a practice in Los Angeles that became Frank Gehry and Associates in 1967,[11] then Gehry Partners in 2001.[20] His earliest commissions were in Southern California, where he designed a number of innovative commercial structures such as Santa Monica Place (1980) and residential buildings such as the eccentric Norton House (1984) in Venice, California.[21]\\n Among these works, Gehry\\'s most notable design may be the renovation of his own Santa Monica residence.[22] Originally built in 1920 and purchased by Gehry in 1977, it features a metallic exterior wrapped around the original building that leaves many of the original details visible.[23] Gehry still resides there.\\n Other of Gehry\\'s buildings completed during the 1980s include the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium (1981) in San Pedro, and the California Aerospace Museum (1984) at the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles.\\n In 1989, Gehry received the Pritzker Architecture Prize, where the jury described him: \"Always open to experimentation, he has as well a'),\n",

His buildings are juxtaposed collages of spaces and materials that make users appreciative of both the theatre and the back-stage, simultaneously revealed.\"[24]\\n Gehry continued to design other notable buildings in California, such as the Chiat/Day Building (1991) in Venice, in collaboration with Claes Oldenburg, which is well known for its massive sculpture of binoculars. He also began receiving larger national and international commissions, including his first European commission, the Vitra International Furniture Manufacturing Facility and Design Museum in Germany, completed in 1989. It was soon followed by other major commissions including the Frederick Weisman Museum of Art[25] (1993) in Minneapolis, Minnesota; the Cinémathèque Française[26](1994) in Paris, originally The American Center in Paris;[27] and the Dancing House[28] (1996) in Prague.\\n From 1994 to 1996 a couple buildings by Gehry for a Public housing project were realized in Goldstein, part of Frankfurt-Schwanheim (1994)\\nIn 1997, Gehry vaulted to a new level of international acclaim[2] when the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened in Bilbao, Spain. Hailed by The New Yorker as a \"masterpiece of the 20th century\", and by legendary architect Philip Johnson as \"the greatest building of our time\",[29] the museum became famous for its striking yet aesthetically pleasing design and its positive economic effect on the city.\\n Since then, Gehry has regularly won major commissions and established himself as one of the world\\'s most notable architects. His best-received works include several concert halls for classical music. The boisterous, curvaceous Walt Disney Concert Hall (2003) in downtown Los Angeles is the centerpiece of the neighborhood\\'s revitalization; the Los Angeles Times called it \"the most effective answer to doubters, naysayers, and grumbling critics an American architect has ever produced\".[30] Gehry also designed the open-air Jay Pritzker Pavilion (2004) in Chicago\\'s Millennium Park;[31] and the understated New World Center (2011) in Miami Beach, which the LA Times called \"a piece of architecture that dares you to underestimate it or write it off at first glance.\"[32'),\n",

Lewis Library (2008) at Princeton University;[34] museums such as the Museum of Pop Culture (2000) in Seattle, Washington;[35] commercial buildings such as the IAC Building (2007) in New York City;[36] and residential buildings, such as Gehry\\'s first skyscraper, the Beekman Tower at 8 Spruce Street (2011)[37] in New York City.\\n Gehry\\'s recent major international works include the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building at the University of Technology Sydney, completed in 2014,[38] and the Chau Chak Wing, with its 320,000 bricks in \"sweeping lines\", described as \"10 out of 10\" on a scale of difficulty.[39] An ongoing project is the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi on Saadiyat Island in the United Arab Emirates.[40] Other significant projects such as the Mirvish Towers in Toronto,[41] and a multi-decade renovation of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, are currently in the design stage. In October 2013, Gehry was appointed joint architect with Foster + Partners to design the High Street phase of the development of Battersea Power Station in London, Gehry\\'s first project there.[42]\\n In recent years, some of Gehry\\'s more prominent designs have failed to go forward. In addition to unrealized designs for the Corcoran Art Gallery expansion in Washington, DC, and a new Guggenheim museum near the South Street Seaport in New York City, Gehry was notoriously dropped by developer Bruce Ratner from the Pacific Park (Brooklyn) redevelopment project, and in 2014 as the designer of the World Trade Center Performing Arts Center in New York City.[43] Some stalled projects have recently shown progress: After many years and a dismissal, Gehry was recently reinstated as architect for the Grand Avenue Project in Los Angeles, and though his controversial[44][45][46] design of the National Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial in Washington, DC has had numerous delays during the approval process with the United States Congress, it was finally approved in 2014 with a modified design.\\n In 2014, two significant, long-awaited museums designed by Gehry opened: the Biomuseo,[47] a biodiversity museum in Panama City, Panama; and the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Frank_Gehry.txt'}, page_content=': the Biomuseo,[47] a biodiversity museum in Panama City, Panama; and the Fondation Louis Vuitton,[48][49][50] a modern art museum in the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris, France, which opened to some rave reviews.[51]\\n Also in 2014, Gehry was commissioned by River LA (formerly the Los Angeles River Revitalization Corporation), a nonprofit group founded by the city of Los Angeles in 2009 to coordinate river policy, to devise a wide-ranging new plan for the river.[52][53]\\n In February 2015, the new AU$180\\xa0million building for the University of Technology Sydney was officially opened, whose façade has more than 320,000 hand-placed bricks and glass slabs. Gehry said he would not design a building like the \"crumpled paper bag\" again.[54]\\n Gehry told the French newspaper La Croix in November 2016 that President of France François Hollande had assured him he could relocate to France if Donald Trump was elected President of the United States.[55][56] The following month, Gehry said that he had no plans to move.[57] Trump and he exchanged words in 2010 when Gehry\\'s 8 Spruce Street, originally known as Beekman Tower, was built 1 foot (0.30\\xa0m) taller than the nearby Trump Building, which until then was New York City\\'s tallest residential building.[56][58]\\n Notable Gehry-designed buildings completed in the 2020s include the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial in Washington, DC[59] and the LUMA Arles museum in France.[60] In 2021, noting Gehry\\'s progress on an increasing number of significant projects in his hometown, including the Grand Avenue Project, a concert hall for the Youth Orchestra Los Angeles, and an office building for Warner Bros., The Architect\\'s Newspaper stated that \"Seventy-four years after he moved there from his native Toronto, L.A. is looking more and more like Gehry Country.\"[61]\\n \\n Architectural style \\n [edit] Said to \"defy categorisation\", Gehry\\'s work reflects a spirit of experimentation coupled with a respect for the demands of professional practice, and has remained largely unaligned with broader stylistic tendencies or movements.[62] With his earliest educational influences rooted in modernism, Gehry\\'s work has sought to escape modernist stylistic tropes while remaining interested in some of its underlying transformative agendas.

Continually working between given circumstances and unanticipated materializations, he has been assessed as someone who \"made us produce buildings that are fun, sculpturally exciting, good experiences\", although his approach may become \"less relevant as pressure mounts to do more with less\".[62]\\n Gehry\\'s style at times seems unfinished or even crude, but his work is consistent with the California \"funk\" art movement of the 1960s and early 1970s, which featured the use of inexpensive found objects and nontraditional media such as clay to make serious art.[63] His works always have at least some element of deconstructivism;[64] he has been called \"the apostle of chain-link fencing and corrugated metal siding\".[65] However, a retrospective exhibit at New York\\'s Whitney Museum in 1988 revealed that he is also a sophisticated classical artist who knows European art history and contemporary sculpture and painting.[63]\\n \\n Gallery \\n [edit] \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t  Former Rouse Headquarters in Columbia, MD (1974) \\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t Merriweather Post Pavillion in Columbia, MD (1967)\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\"El Peix\", fish sculpture in front of the Port Olímpic in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain (1992)\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tDancing House in Prague (1996)\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle (2000)\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tGehry Tower in Hanover, Germany (2001)\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tWeatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio (2002)\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tWalt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles (2003)\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tRichard B.

Indeed, over $3.5 billion have been added to the Basque economy since the building opened.[67] In subsequent years there have been many attempts to replicate this effect through large-scale eye-catching architectural commissions that have been both successful and unsuccessful, such as Daniel Libeskind\\'s expansion of the Denver Art Museum and buildings by Gehry himself, such as the almost universally well-received'),\n",

Art historian Hal Foster reads Gehry\\'s architecture as, primarily, in the service of corporate branding.[70] Criticism of his work includes complaints over design flaws that the buildings waste structural resources by creating functionless forms, do not seem to belong in their surroundings or enhance the public context of their locations, and are apparently designed without taking into account the local climate.[71][72][73]\\n Moreover, socialist magazine Jacobin pointed out that Gehry\\'s work can be summed up as architecture for the super-wealthy, in the sense that it is expensive, not resourceful, and does not serve the interests of the overwhelming majority. The article criticized Gehry\\'s statement, \"In the world we live in, 98 percent of what gets built and designed today is pure shit\".[74]\\n \\n Other aspects of career \\n [edit] \\n Academia \\n [edit] In January 2011, Gehry joined the University of Southern California (USC) faculty, as the Judge Widney Professor of Architecture.[75] He has since continued in this role at his alma mater. He has also held teaching positions at Harvard University, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of Toronto, Columbia University, the Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich, and at Yale University, where he still teaches as of 2017.[76]\\n Though he is often referred to as a \"starchitect\", he has repeatedly expressed his disdain for the term, insisting he is only an architect.[69][77] Steve Sample, President of the University of Southern California, told Gehry that \"...After George Lucas, you are our most prominent graduate\".\\n As of December 2013[update], Gehry has received over a dozen honorary university degrees (see #Honorary doctorates).\\n In February 2017, MasterClass announced an online architecture course taught by Gehry that was released that July.[78]\\n \\n Exhibition design \\n [edit] Gehry has been involved in exhibition designs at the Los Angeles'),\n",

In 1965, Gehry designed the exhibition display for the \"Art Treasures of Japan\" exhibition at the LACMA. This was followed soon after by the exhibition design for the \"Assyrian Reliefs\" show in 1966 and the \"Billy Al Bengston Retrospective\" in 1968. The LACMA then had Gehry design the installation for the \"Treasures of Tutankhamen\" exhibition in 1978 followed by the \"Avant-Garde in Russia 1910–1930\" exhibition in 1980. The subsequent year, Gehry designed the exhibition for \"Seventeen Artists in the \\'60s\" at the LACMA, followed soon after by the \"German Expressionist Sculpture Exhibition\" in 1983. In 1991–92, Gehry designed the installation of the landmark exhibition \"Degenerate Art: The Fate of the Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany\", which opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and traveled to the Art Institute of Chicago, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, and the Altes Museum in Berlin.[79][80] Gehry was asked to design an exhibition on the work of Alexander Calder at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art\\'s Resnick Pavilion, again invited by the museum\\'s curator Stephanie Barron.[81] The exhibition began on November 24, 2013, and ran through July 27, 2014.\\n In addition to his long-standing involvement with exhibition design at the LACMA, Gehry has also designed numerous exhibition installations with other institutions. In 1998, \"The Art of the Motorcycle\" exhibition opened at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum with its installation designed by Gehry. This exhibition subsequently traveled to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the Guggenheim Las Vegas.\\n In 2014, he curated an exhibition of photography by his close friend and businessman Peter Arnell that ran from March 5 through April 1 at Milk Studios Gallery in Los Angeles.[82]\\n \\n Stage design \\n [edit] In 1983, Gehry created the stage design for Lucinda Childs\\' dance Available Light, set to music by John Adams. It premiered at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles at the \"Temporary Contemporary\", and was subsequently seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music Opera House in New York City and the Theatre de la'),\n",

The set consisted of two levels angled in relation to each other, with a chain-link backdrop.[83] The piece was revived in 2015,[84] and was performed, among other places, in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, where it was presented by FringeArts, which commissioned the revival.[85]\\n In 2012, Gehry designed the set for the Los Angeles Philharmonic\\'s opera production of Don Giovanni, performed at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.\\n In April 2014, Gehry designed a set for an \"exploration of the life and career of Pierre Boulez\" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which was performed in November of that year.[86]\\n \\n Other designs \\n [edit]  In addition to architecture, Gehry has made a line of furniture for Knoll and for Heller Furniture, jewelry for Tiffany & Co., various household items, sculptures, and even a glass bottle for Wyborowa Vodka. His first line of furniture, produced from 1969 to 1973, was called \"Easy Edges\", constructed out of cardboard. Another line of furniture released in the spring of 1992 is \"Bentwood Furniture\". Each piece is named after a different hockey term. He was first introduced to making furniture in 1954 while serving in the U.S.\\xa0Army, where he designed furniture for the enlisted soldiers.\\n In many of his designs, Gehry is inspired by fish. \"It was by accident I got into the fish image\", claimed Gehry. One thing that sparked his interest in fish was the fact that his colleagues were recreating Greek temples. He said, \"Three hundred million years before man was fish....if you gotta go back, and you\\'re insecure about going forward...go back three hundred million years ago. Why are you stopping at the Greeks? So, I started drawing fish in my sketchbook, and then I started to realize that there was something in it.\"[87]\\n As a result of his fascination, the first Fish Lamps were fabricated between 1984 and 1986. They employed wire armatures molded into fish shapes, onto which shards of plastic laminate ColorCore are individually glued. Since the creation of the first lamp in 1984, the fish has become a recurrent motif in Gehry\\'s work, most notably in the Fish Sculpture at La Vila Olímpica del Poblenou in Barcelona (1989–92) and'),\n",

In addition to jewelry, Gehry designed other items, including a distinctive collector\\'s chess set and a series of tableware items, including vases, cups, and bowls for the company.[89]\\n In 2004, Gehry designed the official trophy for the World Cup of Hockey.[90] He redesigned the trophy for the next tournament in 2016.[91]\\n He has collaborated with American furniture manufacturer Emeco on designs such as the 2004 \"Superlight\" chair.[92][93]\\n In 2014, Gehry was one of the six \"iconoclasts\" selected by French fashion house Louis Vuitton to design a piece using their iconic monogram pattern as part of their \"Celebrating Monogram\" campaign.[94]\\n In 2015, Gehry designed his first yacht.[95]\\n In 2020, Gehry designed a limited edition bottle of Hennessy cognac.[96]\\n \\n Software development \\n [edit] Gehry\\'s firm was responsible for innovation in architectural software.[97] His firm spun off another firm called Gehry Technologies that was established in 2002. In 2005, Gehry Technologies began a partnership with Dassault Systèmes to bring innovations from the aerospace and manufacturing world to AEC and developed Digital Project software, as well as GTeam software. In 2014, Gehry Technologies was acquired by software company Trimble Navigation.[98] Its client list includes Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Herzog & de Meuron, Jean Nouvel, Coop Himmelb(l)au, and Zaha Hadid.\\n \\n Personal life \\n [edit] In 1954, Gehry changed his surname from Goldberg to Gehry, after his then-wife Anita expressed concern about anti-Semitism.[99]\\n Having grown up in Canada, Gehry is an avid fan of ice hockey. He began a hockey league, FOG (for Frank Owen Gehry), in his office, though he no longer plays with them.[100] In 2004, he designed the trophy for the World Cup of Hockey.[101] A naturalized U.S. citizen,[102] he also remains a citizen of'),\n",

During a trip to Oviedo, Spain to accept the Prince of Asturias Award in October 2014, he received a significant amount of attention, both positive and negative, for publicly flipping off a reporter at a press conference who accused him of being a \"showy\" architect.[105][106]\\n Gehry is a member of the California Yacht Club in Marina Del Rey, and enjoys sailing with his fiberglass-hulled yacht, Foggy.[107] He also serves on the leadership council of The New York Stem Cell Foundation.[108]\\n \\n In popular culture \\n [edit] In 2004, Gehry voiced himself on the children\\'s TV\\xa0show Arthur, where he helped Arthur and his friends design a new treehouse.[109] He also voiced himself in a 2005 episode of The Simpsons, \"The Seven-Beer Snitch\", where he designs a concert hall for the fictional city of Springfield. He has since said he regrets the appearance, as it included a joke about his design technique that has led people to misunderstand his architectural process.[110]\\n In 2006, filmmaker Sydney Pollack made a documentary about Gehry\\'s work, Sketches of Frank Gehry, which followed Gehry over five years and painted a positive portrait of his character; it was well-received critically.[111]\\n In 2009, architecture-inspired ice cream sandwich company Coolhaus named a cookie and ice cream combination after Gehry. Dubbed the \"Frank Behry\", it features Strawberries & Cream gelato and snickerdoodle cookies.[112][113]\\n \\n Works \\n [edit] List of works by Frank Gehry \\n Exhibitions \\n [edit] In October 2014, the first major European exhibition of Gehry\\'s work debuted at the Centre Pompidou in Paris.[114] Other museums and major galleries that have held exhibitions on Gehry\\'s architecture and design include the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1983; and the Walker Art Center in 1986, whose exhibition then traveled to the Toronto Harbourfront Museum, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, the LACMA and the Whitney Museum.

It is a popular poultry dish, especially in North America and the United Kingdom, where it is traditionally consumed as part of culturally significant events such as Thanksgiving and Christmas respectively, as well as in standard cuisine.\\n \\n Preparation and production \\n [edit]  Turkeys are sold sliced and ground, as well as \"whole\" in a manner similar to  chicken with the head, feet, and feathers removed. Turkey \"crowns\" are the breast of the bird with its legs and wings removed.[1][2] Frozen whole turkeys remain popular. Sliced turkey is frequently used as a sandwich meat or served as cold cuts; in some cases where recipes call for chicken, it can be used as a substitute. Ground turkey is sold, and frequently marketed as a healthy alternative to ground beef. Without careful preparation, cooked turkey is usually considered to end up less moist than other poultry meats such as chicken or duck.[citation needed]\\n Wild turkeys, while technically the same species as domesticated turkeys, have a very different taste from farm-raised turkeys. Almost all of the meat is \"dark\" (including the breast) with a more intense flavor. The flavor can also vary seasonally with changes in available forage, often leaving wild turkey meat with a gamier flavor in late summer, due to the greater number of insects in its diet over the preceding months. Wild turkey that has fed predominantly on grass and grain has a milder flavor. Older heritage breeds also differ in flavor.[3] Traditionally raised English turkey meat has been granted the EU and UK designation Traditional Speciality Guaranteed under the name Traditional Farmfresh Turkey.[4]\\n A large amount of turkey meat is processed. It can be smoked, and as such, is sometimes sold as turkey ham or turkey bacon, which is considered to be far healthier[citation needed] than pork bacon. Twisted helices of deep-fried turkey meat, sold as \"turkey twizzlers\", came to prominence in the UK in 2004, when chef Jamie Oliver campaigned to have them and similar foods removed from school dinners.[5]\\n Unlike chicken eggs, turkey eggs are not commonly sold as food due to the high demand for whole turkeys and lower output of eggs as compared with'),\n",

The value of a single turkey egg is estimated to be about $3.50 on the open market.[6][7]\\n \\n Cultural traditions \\n [edit]  World War I Turkeys are traditionally eaten as the main course of Thanksgiving dinner feasts in the United States and Canada,[8] and at Christmas dinner feasts in much of the rest of the world[citation needed] (often as stuffed turkey).\\n Turkey meat has been eaten by indigenous peoples from Mexico, Central America, and the southern tier of the United States since antiquity.  In the 16th century, Spanish conquistadores took Aztec turkeys back to Europe.[9]\\n Turkey was eaten in as early as the 17th century in England.[10] Before the 20th century, pork ribs were the most common food for the North American holidays, as the animals were usually slaughtered in November. Turkeys were once so abundant in the wild that they were eaten throughout the year, the food considered commonplace, whereas pork ribs were rarely available outside of the Thanksgiving–New Year season.[11] While the tradition of turkey at Christmas spread throughout Britain in the 17th century,[10] among the working classes, it became common to serve goose, which remained the predominant roast until the Victorian era.[12]\\n Turkey with mole is regarded as Mexico\\'s \"national dish\".[13][14]\\n Turkey rice is regarded as one of Taiwan\\'s national dishes.[15][16]\\n Because the turkey is a New World bird not known to the Jewish people until after the completion of the Hebrew Bible and Talmud, questions about its kosher status have been discussed for years. The majority of authorities and a long history of Jewish usage have regarded it as kosher, as other related fowl such as chicken, partridge, and pheasant are.[17]\\n \\n Cooking \\n [edit]  Cookbook  turkey Turkeys are usually baked or roasted in an oven for several hours, often while the cook prepares the remainder of the meal. Sometimes, a turkey is brined before roasting to enhance flavor and moisture content. This is done because the dark meat requires a higher temperature to denature all of the myoglobin pigment than the white meat (very low in myoglobin), so that fully cooking the dark meat tends to dry out the breast. Brining makes it possible'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Roast_turkey.txt'}, page_content='), so that fully cooking the dark meat tends to dry out the breast. Brining makes it possible to fully cook the dark meat without drying the breast meat. Turkeys are sometimes decorated with turkey frills, paper frills or \"booties\" that are placed on the end of drumsticks or bones of other cutlets.[20][21]\\n In some areas, particularly the American South, they may also be deep fried in hot oil (often peanut oil) for 30 to 45 minutes by using a turkey fryer. Deep frying turkey has become something of a fad, with hazardous consequences for those unprepared to safely handle the large quantities of hot oil required.[22]\\n  \\n Nutrition \\n [edit] When raw, turkey breast meat is 74% water, 25% protein, 1% fat, and contains no carbohydrates (table).

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Roast_turkey.txt'}, page_content=' turkey  For Thanksgiving in the United States, turkey is traditionally served stuffed or with dressing (on the side), with cranberry sauce and gravy. Common complementary dishes include mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, green beans, squash, and sweet potatoes. Pie is the usual dessert, especially those made from pumpkins, apples, or pecans. It can also be eaten at Christmas in the United States and North America.[citation needed]\\n For Christmas in the United Kingdom, turkey is traditionally served with winter vegetables, including roast potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and parsnips. Cranberry sauce is the traditional condiment in the northern rural areas of the United Kingdom where wild cranberries grow. In the south and in urban areas, where cranberries until recently were difficult to obtain, bread sauce was used in its place, but the availability of commercial cranberry sauce has seen a rise in its popularity in these areas, too.[citation needed] Pigs in blankets, a dish consisting of small sausages (usually chipolatas) wrapped in bacon are a popular and traditional accompaniment.[26][27][28][29][30]\\n Especially during holiday seasons around Thanksgiving and Christmas, stuffing or dressing is traditionally served with turkey. The many varieties include oatmeal, chestnut, sage and onion (flavored bread), cornbread, and sausage are the most traditional. Stuffing is used to stuff the turkey (as the name implies) or may be cooked separately and served as a side dish (dressing).[citation needed]\\n \\n See also \\n [edit]  Media related to Turkey meat at Wikimedia Commons\\n List of turkey meat producing companies in the United States List of stuffed dishes \\n References \\n [edit] ^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-'),\n",

Ferguson Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision ruling that racial segregation laws did not violate the U.S. Constitution as long as the facilities for people of color were equal in quality to those of white people, a doctrine that came to be known as \"separate but equal\".[2][3] The decision legitimized the many state \"Jim Crow laws\" re-establishing racial segregation that had been passed in the American South after the end of the Reconstruction era in 1877. Such legally enforced segregation in the South lasted into the 1960s.\\n The underlying case began in 1892 when Homer Plessy, a mixed-race man, deliberately boarded a whites-only train car in New Orleans. By boarding the whites-only car, Plessy violated Louisiana\\'s Separate Car Act of 1890, which required \"equal, but separate\" railroad accommodations for white and non-white passengers. Plessy was charged under the Act, and at his trial his lawyers argued that judge John Howard Ferguson should dismiss the charges on the grounds that the Act was unconstitutional. Ferguson denied the request, and the Louisiana Supreme Court upheld Ferguson\\'s ruling on appeal. Plessy then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\\n In May 1896, the Supreme Court issued a 7–1 decision against Plessy, ruling that the Louisiana law did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and stating that although the Fourteenth Amendment established the legal equality of whites and blacks, it did not and could not require the elimination of all \"distinctions based upon color\". The Court rejected Plessy\\'s lawyers\\' arguments that the Louisiana law inherently implied that black people were inferior, and gave great deference to American state legislatures\\' inherent power to make laws regulating health, safety, and morals—the \"police power\"—and to determine the reasonableness of the laws they passed. Justice John Marshall Harlan was the lone dissenter from the Court\\'s decision, writing that the U.S. Constitution \"is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens\", and so the laws distinguishing races should have been found unconstitutional.\\n Plessy is widely regarded as one of the worst decisions in U.S. Supreme Court history.[4] Despite'),\n",

Board of Education, which held that the \"separate but equal\" doctrine is unconstitutional in the context of public schools, a series of the Court\\'s later decisions have severely weakened Plessy to the point that it is considered to have been de facto overruled.[6]\\n \\n Background \\n [edit] \\n Legal background and incident \\n [edit] In 1890, the Louisiana State Legislature passed a law called the Separate Car Act, which required separate accommodations for blacks and whites on Louisiana railroads.[7] The law required passenger train officers to \"assign each passenger to the coach or compartment used for the race to which such passenger belongs\". It also made it a misdemeanor for any passenger to \"insist on going into a coach or compartment to which by race he does not belong,\" punishable by either a $25 fine or up to 20 days in prison.\\n A group of prominent black, creole of color, and white creole New Orleans residents formed a civil rights group called the Comité des Citoyens (Committee of Citizens). The group was dedicated to repealing the Separate Car Act and fighting its implementation.[8] The Comité eventually persuaded Homer Plessy, a man of mixed race who was an \"octoroon\" (person of seven-eighths white and one-eighth black ancestry), to participate in an orchestrated test case to challenge the Act. Plessy had been born a free man and was fair-skinned. However, under Louisiana law, he was classified as black, and thus required to sit in the \"colored\" car.[9]\\n On June 7, 1892, Plessy bought a first-class ticket at the Press Street Depot and boarded a \"Whites Only\" car of the East Louisiana Railroad in New Orleans, Louisiana, bound for Covington, Louisiana.[10] The railroad company, which had opposed the law on the grounds that it would require the purchase of more railcars, had been previously informed of Plessy\\'s racial lineage, and the intent to challenge the law.[11] Additionally, the Comité des Citoyens hired a private detective with arrest powers to detain Plessy, to ensure that he would be charged for violating the Separate Car Act, as opposed to vagrancy or'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Plessy_v._Ferguson.txt'}, page_content=' that he would be charged for violating the Separate Car Act, as opposed to vagrancy or some other offense.[11] After Plessy took a seat in the whites-only railway car, he was asked to vacate it, and sit instead in the blacks-only car. Plessy refused and was arrested immediately by the detective.[12] As planned, the train was stopped, and Plessy was taken off the train at Press and Royal streets.[11] Plessy was remanded for trial in Orleans Parish.[13]\\n \\n Trial \\n [edit] Plessy petitioned the state district criminal court to throw out the case, State v. Homer Adolph Plessy,[14] on the grounds that the state law requiring East Louisiana Railroad to segregate trains had denied him his rights under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution,[15] which provided for equal treatment under the law. However, the judge presiding over his case, John Howard Ferguson, ruled that Louisiana had the right to regulate railroad companies while they operated within state boundaries. Four days later, Plessy petitioned the Louisiana Supreme Court for a writ of prohibition to stop his criminal trial.[13][16]\\n \\n State appeal \\n [edit] The Louisiana Supreme Court issued a temporary writ of prohibition while it reviewed Plessy\\'s case. In December 1892, the court upheld Judge Ferguson\\'s ruling,[17] and denied Plessy\\'s attorneys\\' subsequent request for a rehearing.[18][19] In speaking for the court\\'s decision that Ferguson\\'s judgment did not violate the 14th Amendment, Louisiana Supreme Court Justice Charles Erasmus Fenner cited a number of precedents, including two key cases from Northern states. The Massachusetts Supreme Court had ruled in 1849—before the 14th amendment—that segregated schools were constitutional. In answering the charge that segregation perpetuated race prejudice, the Massachusetts court famously stated: \"This prejudice, if it exists, is not created by law, and probably cannot be changed by law.\"[20] The law itself was repealed five years later, but the precedent stood.[21]\\n In a Pennsylvania law mandating separate railcars for different races the Pennsylvania Supreme Court stated: \"To assert separateness is not to declare inferiority ... It is simply to say that following the order of Divine Providence, human authority ought not to compel these widely separated races to intermix.\"[22][21]\\n \\n Supreme Court appeal \\n [edit]'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Plessy_v._Ferguson.txt'}, page_content=' races to intermix.\"[22][21]\\n \\n Supreme Court appeal \\n [edit] Undaunted, the Committee appealed to the United States Supreme Court.[15] Two legal briefs were submitted on Plessy\\'s behalf. One was signed by Albion W. Tourgée and James C. Walker and the other by Samuel F. Phillips and his legal partner F. D. McKenney. Oral arguments were held before the Supreme Court on April 13, 1896. Tourgée and Phillips appeared in the courtroom to speak on behalf of Plessy.[13]\\nTourgée built his case upon violation of Plessy\\'s rights under the 13th Amendment, prohibiting slavery, and the 14th Amendment, which states \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Tourgée argued that the reputation of being a black man was \"property\", which, by the law, implied the inferiority of African Americans as compared to whites.[23] The state legal brief was prepared by Attorney General Milton Joseph Cunningham of Natchitoches and New Orleans. Cunningham was a staunch supporter of white supremacy, who according to a laudatory 1916 obituary \"worked so effectively [during Reconstruction] in restoring white supremacy in politics that he finally was arrested, with fifty-one other men of that community, and tried by federal officials.\"[24]\\n \\n Decision \\n [edit] On May 18, 1896, the Supreme Court issued a 7–1[a] decision against Plessy that upheld the constitutionality of Louisiana\\'s train car segregation laws.[11]\\n \\n Opinion of the Court \\n [edit]  Seven justices formed the Court\\'s majority and joined an opinion written by justice Henry Billings Brown. The Court first dismissed any claim that the Louisiana law violated the Thirteenth Amendment, which, in the majority\\'s opinion, did no more than ensure that black Americans had the basic level of legal equality needed to abolish slavery.[25]\\n Next, the Court considered whether the law violated the Fourteenth Amendment\\'s Equal Protection Clause, which reads: \"nor shall any State ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" The Court said that although the Fourteenth Amendment was meant to guarantee the legal equality of all races in the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Plessy_v._Ferguson.txt'}, page_content=' Court said that although the Fourteenth Amendment was meant to guarantee the legal equality of all races in the United States, it was not intended to prevent social or other types of discrimination.[25]\\n The object of the [Fourteenth] Amendment was undoubtedly to enforce the absolute equality of the two races before the law, but in the nature of things, it could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce social, as distinguished from political equality, or a commingling of the two races upon terms unsatisfactory to either. [26] The Court reasoned that laws requiring racial separation were within Louisiana\\'s police power: the core sovereign authority of U.S. states to pass laws on matters of \"health, safety, and morals\".[25] It held that as long as a law that classified and separated people by their race was a reasonable and good faith exercise of a state\\'s police power and was not designed to oppress a particular class, the law did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.[25] According to the Court, the question in any case that involved a racial segregation law was whether the law was reasonable, and the Court gave State legislatures broad discretion to determine the reasonableness of the laws they passed.[25]\\n Plessy\\'s lawyers had argued that segregation laws inherently implied that black people were inferior, and therefore stigmatized them with a second-class status that violated the Equal Protection Clause.[27] But the Court rejected this argument.[28]\\n We consider the underlying fallacy of the plaintiff\\'s argument to consist in the assumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction on it. [29] The Court rejected the notion that the law marked black Americans with \"a badge of inferiority\", and said that racial prejudice could not be overcome by legislation.[25]\\n \\n Harlan\\'s dissent \\n [edit]  Justice John Marshall Harlan was the lone dissenter from the Court\\'s decision. Harlan strongly disagreed with the Court\\'s conclusion that the Louisiana railcar law did not imply that black people were inferior, and he accused the majority of being willfully ignorant on the issue.\\n Every one knows that the statute in question had its origin in the purpose, not so much to exclude white people from railroad cars occupied by blacks, as to exclude colored people from coaches occupied by or assigned to white persons. ...'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Plessy_v._Ferguson.txt'}, page_content=' occupied by blacks, as to exclude colored people from coaches occupied by or assigned to white persons. ... The thing to accomplish was, under the guise of giving equal accommodation for whites and blacks, to compel the latter to keep to themselves while traveling in railroad passenger coaches. No one would be so wanting in candor as to assert the contrary. [30] To support his argument, Harlan pointed out that the Louisiana law contained an exception for \"nurses attending children of the other race\". This exception allowed black women who were nannies to white children to be in the white-only train cars.[31] Harlan said that this showed that the Louisiana law only allowed black people to be in white-only cars if it was obvious that they were \"social subordinates\" or \"domestics\".[31]\\n In a now-famous passage, Harlan forcefully argued that even though many white Americans of the late 19th century considered themselves superior to those of other races, the U.S. Constitution was \"color-blind\" regarding the law and civil rights.[28] \\n The white race deems itself to be the dominant race in this country. And so it is in prestige, in achievements, in education, in wealth and in power. ... But in view of the constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is no caste here. Our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved. [30] Harlan predicted the Court\\'s decision would eventually become as infamous as its 1857 decision Dred Scott v. Sandford, in which the Court had ruled that black Americans could not be citizens under the U.S. Constitution and that its legal protections and privileges could never apply to them.\\n \\n Aftermath \\n [edit] After the Supreme Court ruling, Plessy\\'s criminal trial went ahead in Ferguson\\'s court in Louisiana on February 11, 1897.[32] Plessy changed his plea to \"guilty\" of violating the Separate Car Act, which carried a $25 fine or 20 days in jail. He opted to pay the fine.[33] The Comité des Citoyens disbanded'),\n",

He opted to pay the fine.[33] The Comité des Citoyens disbanded shortly after the trial\\'s end.[34]\\n \\n Significance \\n [edit]  Oklahoma City [35] Plessy legitimized state laws establishing \"racial\" segregation in the South and provided an impetus for further segregation laws. It also legitimized laws in the North requiring \"racial\" segregation, such as in the Boston school segregation case noted by Justice Brown in his majority opinion.[36] Legislative achievements won during the Reconstruction Era were erased through means of the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.[37] The doctrine had been strengthened also by an 1875 Supreme Court decision that limited the federal government\\'s ability to intervene in state affairs, guaranteeing to Congress only the power \"to restrain states from acts of racial discrimination and segregation\".[38] The ruling basically granted states legislative immunity when dealing with questions of \"race\", guaranteeing the states\\' right to implement racially separate institutions, requiring them only to be equal.[39]\\n  Jim Crow John T. McCutcheon Despite the pretense of \"separate but equal\", non-whites essentially always received inferior facilities and treatment, if they received them at all.[40][page\\xa0needed]\\n The prospect of greater state influence in matters of race worried numerous advocates of civil equality, including Supreme Court Justice John Harlan, who wrote in his Plessy dissent, \"we shall enter upon an era of constitutional law, when the rights of freedom and American citizenship cannot receive from the nation that efficient protection which heretofore was unhesitatingly accorded to slavery and the rights of the master.\"[38] Harlan\\'s concerns about the encroachment on the 14th Amendment would prove well-founded; states proceeded to institute segregation-based laws that became known as the Jim Crow system.[41] In addition, from 1890 to 1908, Southern states passed new or amended constitutions including provisions that effectively disenfranchised blacks and thousands of poor whites.\\n \\nSome commentators, such as Gabriel J. Chin[42] and Eric Maltz,[43] have viewed Harlan\\'s Plessy dissent in a more critical light, and suggested it be viewed in context with his other decisions.[42] Maltz has argued that \"modern commentators have often overstated Harlan\\'s distaste for race-based classifications\", pointing to other aspects of decisions in which Harlan was involved.[44] Both point to a passage of Harlan\\'s Plessy dissent as particularly troubling:[45'),\n",

Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race. But, by the statute in question, a Chinaman can ride in the same passenger coach with white citizens of the United States, while citizens of the black race in Louisiana, many of whom, perhaps, risked their lives for the preservation of the Union\\xa0... and who have all the legal rights that belong to white citizens, are yet declared to be criminals, liable to imprisonment, if they ride in a public coach occupied by citizens of the white race.[47] New Orleans historian Keith Weldon Medley, author of We As Freemen: Plessy v. Ferguson, The Fight Against Legal Segregation, said the words in Justice Harlan\\'s \"Great Dissent\" were taken from papers filed with the court by \"The Citizen\\'s Committee\".[48]\\n The effect of the Plessy ruling was immediate; there were already significant differences in funding for the segregated school system, which continued into the 20th century; states consistently underfunded black schools, providing them with substandard buildings, textbooks, and supplies. States which had successfully integrated elements of their society abruptly adopted oppressive legislation that erased reconstruction era efforts.[49]:\\u200a16–18\\u200a The principles of Plessy v. Ferguson were affirmed in Lum v. Rice (1927), which upheld the right of a Mississippi public school for white children to exclude a Chinese American girl. Despite the laws enforcing compulsory education, and the lack of public schools for Chinese children in Lum\\'s area, the Supreme Court ruled that she had the choice to attend a private school.[50] Jim Crow laws and practices spread northward in response to a second wave of African-American migration from the South to northern and midwestern cities. Some established de jure segregated educational facilities, separate public institutions such as hotels and restaurants, separate beaches among other public facilities, and restrictions on interracial marriage, but in other cases segregation in the North was related to unstated practices and operated on a de facto basis, although not by law, among numerous other facets of daily life.[49]:\\u200a6\\u200a\\n The separate facilities and institutions accorded to the African-American community were consistently inferior[51] to those provided to the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Plessy_v._Ferguson.txt'}, page_content=' institutions accorded to the African-American community were consistently inferior[51] to those provided to the White community. This contradicted the vague declaration of \"separate but equal\" issued after the Plessy decision.[52] Since no state wrote the \"separate but equal\" doctrine into a statute, there was no remedy, other than going back to the U.S. Supreme Court, if the separate facilities were not equal, and states faced no consequences if they underfunded services and facilities for non-whites.[citation needed]\\n From 1890 to 1908, state legislatures in the South disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites through rejecting them for voter registration and voting: making voter registration more difficult by providing more detailed records, such as proof of land ownership or literacy tests administered by white staff at poll stations. African-American community leaders, who had achieved brief political success during the Reconstruction era and even into the 1880s, lost gains made when their voters were excluded from the political system. Historian Rogers Smith noted on the subject that \"lawmakers frequently admitted, indeed boasted, that such measures as complex registration rules, literacy and property tests, poll taxes, white primaries, and grandfather clauses were designed to produce an electorate confined to a white race that declared itself supreme\", notably rejecting the 14th and 15th Amendments to the American Constitution.[53]\\n In Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the US Supreme Court ruled that segregation in public education was unconstitutional.[54] While Plessy v. Ferguson was never explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court, it is effectively dead as a precedent;[55] the Interstate Commerce Commission ruled that segregation on interstate transport violated the Interstate Commerce Act in the 1955 case Keys v. Carolina Coach Co. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited legal segregation and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 provided for federal oversight and enforcement of voter registration and voting.[citation needed]\\n \\n Plessy and Ferguson Foundation \\n [edit] In 2009, Keith Plessy and Phoebe Ferguson, descendants of participants on both sides of the 1896 Supreme Court case, announced the establishment of the Plessy and Ferguson Foundation for Education and Reconciliation.

He led the United States through the American Civil War, defending the nation as a constitutional union, defeating the Confederacy, playing a major role in the abolition of slavery, expanding the power of the federal government, and modernizing the U.S. economy.\\n Lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in Kentucky and was raised on the frontier, mainly in Indiana. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator, and U.S. representative from Illinois. In 1849, he returned to his successful law practice in Springfield, Illinois. In 1854, angered by the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which opened the territories to slavery, he re-entered politics. He soon became a leader of the new Republican Party. He reached a national audience in the 1858 Senate campaign debates against Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln ran for president in 1860, sweeping the North to gain victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South viewed his election as a threat to slavery, and Southern states began seceding from the nation. They formed the Confederate States of America, which began seizing federal military bases in the South. A little over one month after Lincoln assumed the presidency, Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter, a U.S. fort in South Carolina. Following the bombardment, Lincoln mobilized forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the union.\\n Lincoln, a moderate Republican, had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents from both the Democratic and Republican parties. His allies, the War Democrats and the Radical Republicans, demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates. He managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. Anti-war Democrats (called \"Copperheads\") despised Lincoln, and some irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements went so far as to plot his assassination. His Gettysburg Address came to be seen as one of the greatest and most influential statements of American national purpose. Lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals, and implemented a naval blockade of the South\\'s trade. He suspended habeas corpus in Maryland and'),\n",

He suspended habeas corpus in Maryland and elsewhere, and he averted war with Britain by defusing the Trent Affair. In 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the slaves in the states \"in rebellion\" to be free. It also directed the Army and Navy to \"recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons\" and to receive them \"into the armed service of the United States.\" Lincoln unsuccessfully pressured border states to outlaw slavery, and he promoted the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished slavery, except as punishment for a crime. Lincoln managed his own successful re-election campaign. He sought to heal the war-torn nation through reconciliation. On April 14, 1865, just five days after the Confederate surrender at Appomattox, he was attending a play at Ford\\'s Theatre in Washington, D.C., with his wife, Mary, when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth.\\n Lincoln is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery. Lincoln is often ranked in both popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in American history.\\n \\n Family and childhood \\n \\n Early life \\n Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, the second child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks Lincoln, in a log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky.[2] He was a descendant of Samuel Lincoln, an Englishman who migrated from Hingham, Norfolk, to its namesake, Hingham, Massachusetts, in 1638. The family then migrated west, passing through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.[3] Lincoln was also a descendant of the Harrison family of Virginia; his paternal grandfather and namesake, Captain Abraham Lincoln and wife Bathsheba (née Herring) moved the family from Virginia to Jefferson County, Kentucky.[b] The captain was killed in an Indian raid in 1786.[5] His children, including eight-year-old Thomas, Abraham\\'s father, witnessed the attack.[6][c] Thomas then worked at odd jobs in Kentucky and Tennessee before the family settled in Hardin County, Kentucky, in the early 1800s.[6]\\n  Spencer County, Indiana Lincoln\\'s mother Nancy Lincoln is widely assumed to be the daughter of Lucy Hanks.[8] Through his mother’s family,'),\n",

Thomas and Nancy married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to Elizabethtown, Kentucky.[9] They had three children: Sarah, Abraham, and Thomas, who died as an infant.[10]\\n Thomas Lincoln bought multiple farms in Kentucky, but could not get clear titles to any, losing hundreds of acres of land in property disputes.[11] In 1816, the family moved to Indiana, where the land surveys and titles were more reliable.[12] They settled in an \"unbroken forest\"[13] in Hurricane Township, Perry County, Indiana.[14] When the Lincolns moved to Indiana it \"had just been admitted to the Union\" as a \"free\" (non-slaveholding) state,[15] except that, though \"no new enslaved people were allowed, ... currently enslaved individuals remained so\".[16][d] In 1860, Lincoln noted that the family\\'s move to Indiana was \"partly on account of slavery\", but mainly due to land title difficulties.[18][19]\\n In Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter.[20] At various times he owned farms, livestock, and town lots, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, and served on county patrols. Thomas and Nancy were members of the Separate Baptist Church, \"condemned profanity, intoxication, gossip, horse racing, and dancing.\" Most of its members opposed slavery.[21]\\n Overcoming financial challenges, Thomas in 1827 obtained clear title to 80 acres (32\\xa0ha) in Indiana, an area that became known as Little Pigeon Creek Community.[22]\\n \\n Mother\\'s death \\n On October 5, 1818, Nancy Lincoln died from milk sickness, leaving 11-year-old Sarah in charge of a household including her father, nine-year-old Abraham, and Nancy\\'s 19-year-old orphan cousin, Dennis Hanks.[23] Ten years later, on January 20, 1828, Sarah died while giving birth to a stillborn son, devastating Lincoln.[24]\\n On December 2, 1819, Thomas married Sarah Bush Johnston, a widow from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, with three children of her own.[25] Abraham became close to his stepmother and called her \"Mother\".[26] Dennis Hanks said he was lazy, for'),\n",

It included two short stints in Kentucky, where he learned to read, but probably not to write. In Indiana at age seven,[31] due to  farm chores, he attended school only sporadically, for a total of fewer than 12 months in aggregate by age 15.[32] Nonetheless, he remained an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning.[33] Family, neighbors, and schoolmates recalled that his readings included the King James Bible, Aesop\\'s Fables, John Bunyan\\'s The Pilgrim\\'s Progress, Daniel Defoe\\'s Robinson Crusoe, and The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin.[34] Despite being self-educated, Lincoln was the recipient of honorary degrees later in life, including an honorary Doctor of Laws from Columbia University in June 1861.[35]\\n When Lincoln was a teen, his \"father grew more and more to depend on him for the \\'farming, grubbing, hoeing, making fences\\' necessary to keep the family afloat. He also regularly hired his son out to work ... and by law, he was entitled to everything the boy earned until he came of age\".[36] Lincoln was tall, strong, and athletic, and became adept at using an ax.[37] He was an active wrestler during his youth and trained in the rough catch-as-catch-can style (also known as catch wrestling). He became county wrestling champion at the age of 21.[38] He gained a reputation for his strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with the renowned leader of ruffians known as the Clary\\'s Grove boys.[39]\\n In March 1830, fearing another milk sickness outbreak, several members of the extended Lincoln family, including Abraham, moved west to Illinois, a free state, and settled in Macon County.[40][e] Abraham then became increasingly distant from Thomas, in part, due to his father\\'s lack of interest in education.[42] In 1831, as Thomas and other family members prepared to move to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, Abraham struck out on his own.['),\n",

However, witness testimony, given decades afterward, showed a lack of any specific recollection of a romance between the two.[46] Rutledge died on August 25, 1835, most likely of typhoid fever; Lincoln took the death very hard saying that he could not bear the idea of rain falling on Ann\\'s grave. Lincoln sank into a serious episode of depression, and this gave rise to speculation that he had been in love with her.[47][48][49]\\n In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky.[50] Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Owens if she returned to New Salem. Owens arrived that November and he courted her; however, they both had second thoughts. On August 16, 1837, he wrote Owens a letter saying he would not blame her if she ended the relationship, and she never replied.[51]\\n In 1839, Lincoln met Mary Todd in Springfield, Illinois, and the following year they became engaged.[52] She was the daughter of Robert Smith Todd, a wealthy lawyer and businessman in Lexington, Kentucky.[53] Their wedding, which was set for January 1, 1841, was canceled because Lincoln did not appear, but they reconciled and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield home of Mary\\'s sister.[54] While anxiously preparing for the nuptials, he was asked where he was going and replied, \"To hell, I suppose\".[55] In 1844, the couple bought a house in Springfield near his law office. Mary kept house with the help of a hired servant and a relative.[56]\\n Lincoln was an affectionate husband and father of four sons, though his work regularly kept him away from home.

Herndon would grow irritated when Lincoln brought his children to the law office. Their father, it seemed, was often too absorbed in his work to notice his children\\'s behavior. Herndon recounted, \"I have felt many and many a time that I wanted to wring their little necks, and yet out of respect for Lincoln I kept my mouth shut. Lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done.\"[61]\\n The deaths of their sons Eddie and Willie had profound effects on both parents. Lincoln suffered from \"melancholy\", a condition now thought to be clinical depression.[48] Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and in 1875 Robert committed her to an asylum.[62]\\n \\n Early career and militia service \\n Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War During 1831 and 1832, Lincoln worked at a general store in New Salem, Illinois. In 1832, he declared his candidacy for the Illinois House of Representatives, but interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War.[63] When Lincoln returned home from the Black Hawk War, he planned to become a blacksmith, but instead formed a partnership with 21-year-old William Berry, with whom he purchased a New Salem general store on credit. Because a license was required to sell customers beverages, Berry obtained bartending licenses for $7 each for Lincoln and himself, and in 1833 the Lincoln-Berry General Store became a tavern as well.[citation needed]\\n As licensed bartenders, Lincoln and Berry were able to sell spirits, including liquor, for 12 cents a pint.

The war had begun with a killing of American soldiers by Mexican cavalry patrol in disputed territory, and Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had \"invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil\".[90] Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.[91] The resolution was ignored in both Congress and the national papers, and it cost Lincoln political support in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him \"spotty Lincoln\".[92] Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on presidential war-making powers.[93]\\n Lincoln had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House. Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, he supported General Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election.[94] Taylor won and Lincoln hoped in vain to be appointed Commissioner of the United States General Land Office.[95] The administration offered to appoint him secretary or governor of the Oregon Territory as consolation.[96] This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have disrupted his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.[97]\\n \\n Prairie lawyer \\n List of cases involving Abraham Lincoln  In his Springfield practice, Lincoln handled \"every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer\".[98] Twice a year he appeared for 10 consecutive weeks in county seats in the Midstate county courts; this continued for 16 years.[99] Lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nation\\'s western expansion, particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges.

Douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery. The legislation alarmed many Northerners, who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that could result, but Douglas\\'s Kansas–Nebraska Act narrowly passed Congress in May 1854.[112]\\n Lincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his \"Peoria Speech\" of October 1854. Lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency.[113] He said the Kansas Act had a \"declared indifference, but as I must think, a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world....\"[114] Lincoln\\'s attacks on the Kansas–Nebraska Act marked his return to political life.[115]\\n Nationally the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. Reflecting on the demise of his party, Lincoln wrote in 1855, \"I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist. ... I do no more than oppose the extension of slavery.\"[116] The new Republican Party was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery, drawing from the antislavery wing of the Whig Party and combining Free Soil, Liberty, and antislavery Democratic Party members,[117] Lincoln resisted early Republican entreaties, fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists.[118] Lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the Whigs, though he lamented his party\\'s growing closeness with the nativist Know Nothing movement.[119]\\n In 1854, Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature, but before the term began in January he declined to take his seat so that he would be eligible to be a candidate in the upcoming U.S. Senate election.[120][121] The year\\'s elections showed the strong opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and in the aftermath Lincoln sought election to the U.S. Senate'),\n",

Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull. Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig. Lincoln\\'s decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull\\'s antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, Joel Aldrich Matteson.[123]\\n \\n 1856 campaign \\n Violent political confrontations in Kansas continued, and opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act remained strong throughout the North. As the 1856 elections approached, Lincoln joined the Republicans and attended the Bloomington Convention, which formally established the Illinois Republican Party. The convention platform endorsed Congress\\'s right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the final speech of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union.[124] At the June 1856 Republican National Convention, though Lincoln received support to run as vice president, John C. Frémont and William Dayton were on the ticket, which Lincoln supported throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Secretary of State James Buchanan and the Know-Nothings nominated former Whig President Millard Fillmore.[125] Buchanan prevailed, while Republican William Henry Bissell won election as Governor of Illinois, and Lincoln became a leading Republican in Illinois.[126][h]\\n \\n Dred Scott v.

Taney wrote that black people were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution, and that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional for infringing upon slave owners\\' \"property\" rights.

Many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln\\'s 1856 campaigning and support of Trumbull had earned him a favor.[132] Some eastern Republicans supported Douglas for his opposition to the Lecompton Constitution and admission of Kansas as a slave state.[133] Many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the nomination with little opposition.[134]\\n  Mathew Brady Cooper Union speech Lincoln accepted the nomination with great enthusiasm and zeal. After his nomination he delivered his House Divided Speech, with the biblical reference Mark 3:25, \"A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.\"[135] The speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion.[136] The stage was then set for the election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas.[137] When informed of Lincoln\\'s nomination, Douglas stated, \"[Lincoln] is the strong man of the party\\xa0... and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won.\"[138]\\n The Senate campaign featured seven debates between Lincoln and Douglas. These were the most famous political debates in American history; they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands.[139] The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically.

In his Freeport Doctrine, Douglas argued that, despite the Dred Scott decision, which he claimed to support,[140] local settlers, under the doctrine of popular sovereignty, should be free to choose whether to allow slavery within their territory, and he accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.[141] Lincoln\\'s argument assumed a moral tone, as he claimed that Douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery. Douglas\\'s argument was more legal in nature, claiming that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court as exercised in the Dred Scott decision.[142]\\n Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas. However, Lincoln\\'s articulation of the issues had given him a national political presence.[143] In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats-Anzeiger, a German-language newspaper that was consistently supportive; most of the state\\'s 130,000 German Americans voted for Democrats, but the German-language paper mobilized Republican support.[144] In the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate, rivaled by William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Simon Cameron. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast and was unsure whether to seek the office.[145] In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the presidential nomination if offered and, in the following months, several local papers endorsed his candidacy.[146]\\n Over the coming months Lincoln was tireless, making nearly fifty speeches along the campaign trail. By the quality and simplicity of his rhetoric, he quickly became the champion of the Republican party. However, despite his overwhelming support in the Midwestern United States, he was less appreciated in the east. Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, at that time wrote up an unflattering account of Lincoln\\'s compromising position on slavery and his reluctance to challenge the court\\'s Dred Scott ruling, which was promptly used against him by his political rivals.[147][148]\\n On February 27, 1860, powerful New York Republicans invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union, in which he argued that the Founding Fathers of the United States had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery.

At times he was presented as the plain-talking \"Rail Splitter\" and at other times he was \"Honest Abe\", unpolished but trustworthy.[158]\\n On May 18 at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket. Lincoln\\'s success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff.[159] Pennsylvania put him over the top, led by the state\\'s iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support.[160] Lincoln\\'s managers had focused on this delegation while honoring Lincoln\\'s dictate to \"Make no contracts that will bind me\".[161]\\n As the Slave Power tightened its grip on the national government, most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the'),\n",

Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession.[162] When Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats, delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the Democratic convention; they opposed Douglas\\'s position on popular sovereignty, and selected incumbent Vice President John C. Breckinridge as their candidate.[163] A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the Constitutional Union Party and nominated John Bell of Tennessee. Lincoln and Douglas competed for votes in the North, while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South.[132]\\n Before the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the Wide Awakes, which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties.[164] People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln and rallied supporters for Lincoln.[165]\\n As Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln gave no speeches, relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. Republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln\\'s life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the power of \"free labor\", which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts.[166] The Republican Party\\'s production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln\\'s life and sold 100,000–200,000 copies.[167] Though he did not give public appearances, many sought to visit him and write him. In the runup to the election, he took an office in the Illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention. He also hired John George Nicolay as his personal secretary, who would remain in that role during the presidency.[168]\\n On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president. He was the first Republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the North and West.

Due to secessionist plots, a then-unprecedented attention to security was given to him and his train. En route to his inauguration, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North.[187] The president-elect evaded suspected assassins in Baltimore. He traveled in disguise, wearing a soft felt hat instead of his customary stovepipe hat and draping an overcoat over his shoulders while hunching slightly to conceal his height. His friend Congressman Elihu B. Washburne recognized him on the platform upon arrival and loudly called out to him.[188] On February 23, 1861, he arrived in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard.[189] Lincoln directed his inaugural address to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the Southern states:\\n Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States, that by the accession of a Republican Administration, their property, and their peace, and personal security, are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed, and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you.

I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\" First inaugural address [190] [191]  Lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between North and South, stating \"One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute.\" The president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: \"We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies....

By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated.[193] In his second inaugural address, Lincoln looked back on the situation at the time and said: \"Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.\"\\n \\n Civil War \\n American Civil War Battle of Fort Sumter  Major Robert Anderson, commander of the Union\\'s Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, sent a request for provisions to Washington, and Lincoln\\'s order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter and began the fight. Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and overlooking Southern Unionist opposition to an invasion.[194]\\n William Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was \"sadly disappointed\" at his failure to realize that \"the country was sleeping on a volcano\" and that the South was preparing for war.[195] Donald concludes, \"His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Fort Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he had also vowed not to surrender the forts.... The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the Confederates to fire the first shot\". They did just that.[196]\\n On April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send a total of 75,000 volunteer troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and \"preserve the Union\", which, in his view, remained intact despite the seceding states.

Local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in an effort to protect the troops trying to reach Washington.[198] John Merryman, one Maryland official hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus. In June, in Ex parte Merryman, Taney, not ruling on behalf of the Supreme Court,[199] issued the writ, believing that Article I, section 9 of the Constitution authorized only Congress and not the president to suspend it. But Lincoln invoked nonacquiescence and persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas.[200][201]\\n \\n Union military strategy \\n Lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the Union military strategy. He responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as commander-in-chief by exercising unprecedented authority. He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended habeas corpus, and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln gained the support of Congress and the northern public for these actions. Lincoln also had to reinforce Union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict.[202]\\n  William Fessenden Edwin Stanton William Seward Gideon Welles It was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success, and that any compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery. The Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery.[203] On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act of 1861, which authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederates. The law had little practical effect, but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery.[204]\\n In August 1861, General John C.

Frémont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, without consulting Washington, issued a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels. Lincoln canceled the proclamation as violating the Confiscation Act of 1861 and beyond Frémont\\'s authority to issue.[205] As a result, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000.[206]\\n Internationally, Lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the Confederacy.[207] He relied on his combative Secretary of State William Seward while working closely with Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Charles Sumner.[208] In the 1861 Trent Affair, which threatened war with Great Britain, the U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British mail ship, the Trent, on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. Biographer James G. Randall dissected Lincoln\\'s successful techniques:[209]\\n his restraint, his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence, his early softening of State Department\\'s attitude toward Britain, his deference toward Seward and Sumner, his withholding of his paper prepared for the occasion, his readiness to arbitrate, his golden silence in addressing Congress, his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted, and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for America\\'s true position at the same time that full satisfaction was given to a friendly country. Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the War Department. He tracked all phases of the effort, consulting with governors and selecting generals based on their success, their state, and their party. In January 1862, after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced War Secretary Simon Cameron with Edwin Stanton. Stanton centralized the War Department\\'s activities, auditing and canceling contracts, saving the federal government $17,000,000.[210] Stanton was a staunch Unionist, pro-business, conservative Democrat who gravitated toward the Radical Republican faction. He worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than did any other senior official. \"Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together\", say Thomas and Hyman.[211]\\n Lincoln\\'s war strategy had two priorities: ensuring that Washington was well-defended and conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt, decisive victory.[j] Twice a week, Lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon.

Lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River.[214] Lincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than merely capturing territory.[215]\\n In directing the Union's war strategy, Lincoln valued the advice of Gen. Winfield Scott, even after his retirement as Commanding General of the United States Army. On June 23–24, 1862, Lincoln made an unannounced visit to West Point, where he spent five hours consulting with Scott regarding the handling of the Civil War and the staffing of the War Department.[216][217]\\n \\n General McClellan \\n After the Union rout at Bull Run and Winfield Scott's retirement, Lincoln appointed Major General George B. McClellan general-in-chief.[218] McClellan then took months to plan his Virginia Peninsula Campaign.

McClellan, in turn, blamed the failure of the campaign on Lincoln's reservation of troops for the capital.[219]\\n   Battle of Antietam Delos Sackett George W. Morell Alexander S.

Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans; and after the 1862 midterm elections he replaced McClellan with Ambrose Burnside. The appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on Lincoln's part.[226]\\n Against presidential advice Burnside launched an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December. Desertions during 1863 came in the thousands and only increased after Fredericksburg, so Lincoln replaced Burnside with Joseph Hooker.[227]\\n In the 1862 midterm elections, the Republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation, high taxes, rumors of corruption, suspension of habeas corpus, military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would come North and undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation gained votes for Republicans in rural New England and the upper Midwest, but cost votes in the Irish and German strongholds and in the lower Midwest, where many Southerners had lived for generations.[228]\\n In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near; the plans included attacks by Hooker on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans on Chattanooga, Grant on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.[229]\\n Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, then resigned and was replaced by George Meade.[230] Meade followed Lee north into Pennsylvania and beat him in the Gettysburg Campaign, but then failed to follow up despite Lincoln's demands.

Lincoln believed that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented, because these territories would be admitted to the Union as free states, and free states would come to outnumber slave states. He sought to persuade the states to agree to compensation for emancipating their slaves.[232] Lincoln rejected Major General John C. Frémont\\'s August 1861 emancipation attempt, as well as one by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power and might upset loyal border states enough for them to secede.[233]\\n In June 1862, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory, which Lincoln signed. In July, the Confiscation Act of 1862 was enacted, providing court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion; Lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was unconstitutional. He felt such action could be taken only within the war powers of the commander-in-chief, which he planned to exercise. On July 22, 1862, Lincoln reviewed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet.[234]\\n Peace Democrats (Copperheads) argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification, but Republican editor Horace Greeley of the New-York Tribune, in his public letter, \"The Prayer of Twenty Millions\", implored Lincoln to embrace emancipation.[235][236] In a public letter of August 22, 1862, Lincoln replied to Greeley, writing that while he personally wished all men could be free, his first obligation as president was to preserve the Union:[237]\\n My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union\\xa0... [¶] I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.[238] When Lincoln published his reply to Greeley, he had already decided to issue the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation and therefore had already'),\n",

Some scholars, therefore, believe that his reply to Greeley was disingenuous and was intended to reassure white people who would have opposed a war for emancipation that emancipation was merely a means to preserve the Union.[239] On September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation,[240] which announced that, in states still in rebellion on January 1, 1863, the slaves would be freed. He spent the next 100 days, between September 22 and January 1, preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites.[241] At the same time, during those 100 days, Lincoln made efforts to end the war with slavery intact, suggesting that he still took seriously the first option he mentioned in his letter to Greeley: saving the Union without freeing any slave.[242] But, on January 1, 1863, keeping his word, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation,[243] freeing the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control,[244] with exemptions specified for areas under such control.[245] Lincoln\\'s comment on signing the Proclamation was: \"I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.\"[246]\\n With the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective, Union armies advancing south \"enable[d] thousands of slaves to escape to freedom\".[247] The Emancipation Proclamation having stated that freedmen would be \"received into the armed service of the United States,\" enlisting these freedmen became official policy. By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to Tennessee military governor Andrew Johnson encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, \"The bare sight of fifty thousand armed, and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once\".[248] By the end of 1863, at Lincoln\\'s direction, General Lorenzo Thomas \"had enrolled twenty regiments of African Americans\" from the Mississippi Valley.[248]\\n \\n Gettysburg Address (1863) \\n Gettysburg Address  top hat Gettysburg Gettysburg Address American history [249] [250] Lincoln spoke at'),\n",

He defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that the future of democracy would be assured, and that \"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth\".[252]\\n Defying his prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here\", the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.[253]\\n \\n Promoting General Grant \\n  The Peacemakers George P.A.

Meade\\'s failure to capture Lee\\'s army after Gettysburg and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to promote Grant to supreme commander. Grant then assumed command of Meade\\'s army.[255]\\n Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in 1864. He arranged for an intermediary to inquire into Grant\\'s political intentions, and once assured that he had none, Lincoln promoted Grant to the newly revived rank of Lieutenant General, a rank which had been unoccupied since George Washington.[256] Authorization for such a promotion \"with the advice and consent of the Senate\" was provided by a new bill which Lincoln signed the same day he submitted Grant\\'s name to the Senate. His nomination was confirmed by the Senate on March 2, 1864.[257]\\n Grant in 1864 waged the bloody Overland Campaign, which exacted heavy losses on both sides.[258] When Lincoln asked what Grant\\'s plans were, the persistent general replied, \"I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.\"[259] Grant\\'s army moved steadily south.

He emphasized defeat of the Confederate armies over destruction (which was considerable) for its own sake.[262] Lincoln\\'s engagement became distinctly personal on one occasion in 1864 when Confederate general Jubal Early raided Washington, D.C. Legend has it that while Lincoln watched from an exposed position, Union Captain (and future Supreme Court Justice) Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. shouted at him, \"Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!\" But this story is commonly regarded as apocryphal.[263][264][265][266]\\n As Grant continued to weaken Lee\\'s forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President Stephens led a group meeting with Lincoln, Seward, and others at Hampton Roads. Lincoln refused to negotiate with the Confederacy as a coequal; his objective to end the fighting was not realized.[267] On April 1, 1865, Grant nearly encircled Petersburg in a siege. The Confederate government evacuated Richmond and Lincoln visited the conquered capital. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox, officially ending the war.[268]\\n \\n Reelection \\n 1864 United States presidential election  electoral  Andrew Johnson Lincoln ran for reelection in 1864, while uniting the main Republican factions along with War Democrats Edwin M.

Meanwhile, Lincoln emboldened Grant with more troops and Republican party support. Sherman\\'s capture of Atlanta in September and David Farragut\\'s capture of Mobile ended defeatism.[273] The Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln.

When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates were to be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let \\'em up easy.\"[278] Lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath, and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states. His main goal was to keep the union together, so he proceeded by focusing not on whom to blame, but on how to rebuild the nation as one.[279] Lincoln led the moderates in Reconstruction policy and was opposed by the Radicals, under Rep. Thaddeus Stevens, Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. Benjamin Wade, who otherwise remained Lincoln\\'s allies. Determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office and had not mistreated Union prisoners, if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance.[280]\\n  As Southern states fell, they needed leaders while their administrations were restored. In Tennessee and Arkansas, Lincoln respectively appointed Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed, and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery. Democratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans\\' political aspirations. The Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the 1864 Wade–Davis Bill, which Lincoln vetoed. The Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.[281]\\n Lincoln\\'s appointments were designed to harness both moderates and Radicals. To fill Chief Justice Taney\\'s seat on the Supreme Court, he named the Radicals\\' choice, Salmon P. Chase, whom Lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies.[282]\\n After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment. He declared that such an amendment would \"clinch the whole subject\" and by December 1863 an amendment was brought to Congress.[283] The Senate passed it'),\n",

Passage became part of Lincoln\\'s reelection platform, and after his successful reelection, the second attempt in the House passed on January 31, 1865.[284] With ratification, it became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865.[285]\\n Lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed Senator Charles Sumner\\'s Freedmen\\'s Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves. The law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln announced a Reconstruction plan that involved short-term military control, pending readmission under the control of southern Unionists.[286]\\n Historians agree that it is impossible to predict how Reconstruction would have proceeded had Lincoln lived. Biographers James G. Randall and Richard Current, according to David Lincove, argue that:[287]\\n It is likely that had he lived, Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnson\\'s, that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson\\'s mistakes. Eric Foner argues that:[288]\\n Unlike Sumner and other Radicals, Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. He believed, as most Republicans did in April 1865, that voting requirements should be determined by the states. He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former Confederates. But time and again during the war, Lincoln, after initial opposition, had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and Radical Republicans.\\xa0... Lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves.\\xa0... It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on a Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death. \\n Native Americans \\n Lincoln\\'s relationship with Native Americans started before he was born, with their killing of his grandfather in front of his sons, including Lincoln\\'s father'),\n",

While in office his administration faced difficulties guarding Western settlers, railroads, and telegraphs, from Indian attacks.[291]\\n On August 17, 1862, the Dakota War broke out in Minnesota. Hundreds of settlers were killed, 30,000 were displaced from their homes, and Washington was deeply alarmed.[292] Some feared incorrectly that it might represent a Confederate conspiracy to start a war on the Northwestern frontier.[293] Lincoln ordered thousands of Confederate prisoners of war sent by railroad to put down the uprising.[294] When the Confederates protested forcing Confederate prisoners to fight Indians, Lincoln revoked the policy and none arrived in Minnesota. Lincoln sent General John Pope as commander of the new Department of the Northwest two weeks into the hostilities.[295][296] Before he arrived, the Fond Du Lac band of Chippewa sent Lincoln a letter asking to go to war for the United States against the Sioux, so Lincoln could send Minnesota's troops to fight the South.[297][298] Shortly after, a Mille Lacs Band Chief offered the same at St. Cloud, Minnesota.[299][300] In it the Chippewa specified they wanted to use the indigenous rules of warfare.[301] That meant there would be no prisoners of war, no surrender, no peace agreement.[302] Lincoln did not accept the Chippewa offer, as he could not control the Chippewa, and women and children were considered legitimate casualties in native American warfare.[303]\\n Serving under Gen. Pope was Minnesota Congressman Henry H. Sibley. Minnesota's Governor had made Sibley a Colonel United States Volunteers to command the U.S. force tasked with fighting the war and that eventually defeated Little Crow's forces at the Battle of Wood Lake.[296]\\nThe day the Mdewakanton force surrendered at Camp Release, a Chippewa war council met at Minnesota's capitol with another Chippewa offer to Lincoln, to fight the Sioux.[304][additional citation(s) needed] Sibley ordered a military commission to review the actions of the captured, to try those that had committed war crimes.

Pope ordered all detained be tried. 303 were given death sentences that were subject to Presidential review. Lincoln ordered Pope send all trial transcripts to Washington, where Lincoln and two of his staff examined them. Lincoln realized the trials could be divided into two groups: combat between combatants and combat against civilians.[citation needed] The groups could be identified by their transcripts, the first group all had three pages in length while the second group had more, some up to twelve pages.[citation needed] He placed 263 cases into the first group and commuted their sentences. In the second group were forty cases. One he commuted for becoming a state\\'s witness. Sibley dismissed another when proof surfaced exonerating the defendant. The remaining 38 were executed in the largest mass hanging in U.S. history.[citation needed] Questions arose concerning three executions that have not been answered.[306] Less than 4 months afterwards, Lincoln issued the Lieber Code, which governed wartime conduct of the Union Army, by defining command responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Congressman Alexander Ramsey told Lincoln in 1864, he would have gotten more re-election support in Minnesota had he executed all 303 of the Mdewakanton. Lincoln responded, \"I could not afford to hang men for votes.\"[307] The men whose sentences he commuted were sent to a military prison at Davenport, Iowa. Some he released due to the efforts of Bishop Henry Whipple.\\n \\n Whig theory of a presidency \\n Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of a presidency focused on executing laws while deferring to Congress\\' responsibility for legislating. Under this philosophy, Lincoln vetoed only four bills during his presidency, including the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh Reconstruction program.[308] The 1862 Homestead Act made millions of acres of Western government-held land available for purchase at low cost. The 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States\\' first transcontinental railroad, which was completed in 1869.[309] The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was enabled by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.[310]\\n In the selection and'),\n",

I had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men. Then I had no right to deprive the country of their services.\"[312] Goodwin described the group in her biography as a Team of Rivals.[313]\\n There were two measures passed to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third Morrill Tariffs, following the first enacted by Buchanan. He also signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S. income tax—a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 (equivalent to $27,129 in 2023[314]).[315] The Revenue Act of 1862 adopted rates that increased with income.[316]\\n The Lincoln Administration presided over the expansion of the federal government\\'s economic influence in other areas. The National Banking Act created the system of national banks. The U.S. issued paper currency for the first time, known as greenbacks—printed in green on the reverse side.[317] In 1862, Congress created the Department of Agriculture.[315]\\n In response to rumors of a renewed draft, the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others to corner the gold market. Lincoln attacked the media for such behavior, and ordered a military seizure of the two papers which lasted for two days.[318]\\n  Wikisource Thanksgiving Proclamation (1863) Lincoln is largely responsible for the Thanksgiving holiday.[319] Thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in New England in the 17th century. It had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates. The prior proclamation had been during James Madison\\'s presidency 50 years earlier. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving.[319]\\n In June 1864 Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park.[320]\\n \\n Supreme Court appointments \\n Lincoln\\'s philosophy on court nominations was that \"we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we'),\n",

Samuel Freeman Miller supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis was Lincoln\\'s campaign manager in 1860 and had served as a judge in the Illinois court circuit where Lincoln practiced. Democrat Stephen Johnson Field, a previous California Supreme Court justice, provided geographic and political balance. Finally, Lincoln\\'s Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, became Chief Justice. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.[321]\\n \\n Foreign policy \\n Presidency of Abraham Lincoln §\\xa0Foreign policy Diplomacy of the American Civil War Lincoln named his main political rival, William H. Seward, as Secretary of State and left most diplomatic issues in Seward\\'s portfolio. However, Lincoln did select some top diplomats as part of his patronage policy.[322] He also closely watched the handling of the Trent Affair in late 1861 to make sure the situation did not escalate into war with Britain.[323] Seward\\'s main role was to keep Britain and France from supporting the Confederacy. He was successful after indicating to Britain and France that the Union would declare war on them if they supported the South.[324]\\n \\n Assassination \\n Assassination of Abraham Lincoln  John Wilkes Booth Mary Todd Lincoln Clara Harris Henry Rathbone John Wilkes Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service.[325] After attending Lincoln\\'s last public address, on April 11, 1865, in which Lincoln stated his preference that the franchise be conferred on some black men, specifically \"on the very intelligent, and on those who serve our cause as soldiers\",[326] Booth hatched a plot to assassinate the President.[327] When Booth learned of the Lincolns\\' intent to attend a play with General Grant, he planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at Ford\\'s Theatre. \"Booth had attended a dress rehearsal the day before to better rehearse his scheme for shooting Lincoln ... and then escaping.\"[328] Lincoln and his wife attended the play Our American Cousin on the evening of April 14,'),\n",

Lincoln\\'s guest, Major Henry Rathbone, momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.[330] After being attended by Doctor Charles Leale and two other doctors, Lincoln was taken across the street to Petersen House. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 in the morning on April 15.[331][k] Stanton saluted and said, \"Now he belongs to the ages.\"[336][l] Lincoln\\'s body was placed in a flag-wrapped coffin, which was loaded into a hearse and escorted to the White House by Union soldiers.[337] President Johnson was sworn in later that same day.[338]\\n Two weeks later, Booth, refusing to surrender, was tracked to a farm in Virginia. He was mortally shot by Sergeant Boston Corbett and died on April 26. Secretary of War Stanton had issued orders that Booth be taken alive, so Corbett was initially arrested to be court martialed. After a brief interview, Stanton declared him a patriot and dismissed the charge.[339]\\n \\n Funeral and burial \\n State funeral of Abraham Lincoln The late President lay in state, first in the East Room of the White House, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 to 21. The caskets containing Lincoln\\'s body and the body of his son Willie traveled for three weeks on the Lincoln Special funeral train.[340] The train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands. Many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing[341] or in silent grief. Poet Walt Whitman composed \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom\\'d\" to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln.[342] African Americans were especially moved; they had lost their \"Moses\".[343] In a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men'),\n",

He wrote at this time that God \"could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.\"[357]\\n \\nLincoln did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and by 1865 was expressing that belief in major speeches.[350] By the end of the war, he increasingly appealed to the Almighty for solace and to explain events, writing on April 4, 1864, to a newspaper editor in Kentucky:  I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.

If God now wills the removal of a great wrong, and wills also that we of the North as well as you of the South, shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong, impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of God.[358] This spirituality can best be seen in his second inaugural address, considered by some scholars[359] as the greatest such address in American history, and by Lincoln himself as his own greatest speech, or one of them at the very least.[n][360] Lincoln explains therein that the cause, purpose, and result of the war was God\\'s will.[361] Lincoln\\'s frequent use of religious imagery and language toward the end of his life may have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants.[362] On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the Holy Land.[363]\\n \\n Health \\n Health of Abraham Lincoln Lincoln is believed to have had depression, smallpox, and malaria.[364] He took blue mass pills, which contained mercury,[365] to treat constipation.[366] It is unknown to what extent this may have resulted in mercury poisoning.[367]\\n Several claims have been made that Lincoln\\'s health was declining before the assassination. These are often based on photographs of Lincoln appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting.[368] It is also suspected that he might have had a rare genetic disease such as Marfan syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B.[368]\\n \\n Legacy \\n Cultural depictions of Abraham Lincoln \\n Republican values \\n Lincoln\\'s redefinition of republican values has been stressed by historians such as John Patrick Diggins, Harry V. Jaffa, Vernon Burton, Eric Foner, and Herman J. Belz.[369] Lincoln called the Declaration of Independence—which emphasized freedom and equality for all—the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism beginning in the 1850s. He did this at a time when the Constitution, which \"tolerated slavery\", was the focus of most political discourse.[370] Diggins notes, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself\" in the 1860 Cooper Union speech.[371] Instead of'),\n",

Furthermore, it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state.[373] Many soldiers and religious leaders from the north, though, felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs.[374]\\n As a Whig activist Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, infrastructure improvements, and railroads, in opposition to Jacksonian democrats.[375] Lincoln shared the sympathies that the Jacksonians professed for the common man, but he disagreed with the Jacksonian view that the government should be divorced from economic enterprise.[376] Nevertheless, Lincoln admired Andrew Jackson\\'s steeliness as well as his patriotism.[377] According to historian Sean Wilentz:[377]\\n Just as the Republican Party of the 1850s absorbed certain elements of Jacksonianism, so Lincoln, whose Whiggery had always been more egalitarian than that of other Whigs, found himself absorbing some of them as well. And some of the Jacksonian spirit resided inside the Lincoln White House. William C. Harris found that Lincoln\\'s \"reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism.\"[378] James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation \"in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform.\" Randall concludes that \"he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called \\'radicalism\\' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.\"[379]\\n \\n Reunification of the states \\n    Bureau of Engraving and Printing In Lincoln\\'s first inaugural address, he explored the nature of democracy.

The term \"the United States\" has historically been used sometimes in the plural (\"these United States\") and other times in the singular. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.[381]\\n \\n Historical reputation \\n In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color.[382] Frederick Douglass In surveys of U.S. scholars ranking presidents conducted since 1948, the top three presidents are generally Lincoln, Washington, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, although the order varies.[383][o] Between 1999 and 2011, Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan were the top-ranked presidents in eight public opinion surveys, according to Gallup.[385] A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after George Washington.[386]\\n Lincoln\\'s assassination left him a national martyr. He was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln\\'s name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.[387] Historians have said he was \"a classical liberal\" in the 19th-century sense. Allen C. Guelzo states that Lincoln was a \"classical liberal democrat—an enemy of artificial hierarchy, a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling, and an American counterpart to Mill, Cobden, and Bright\", whose portrait Lincoln hung in his White House office.[388][389]\\n Sociologist Barry Schwartz argues that Lincoln\\'s American reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s), when he emerged as one of America\\'s most venerated heroes, even among white Southerners. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.[390]\\n Union nationalism, as envisioned by Lincoln, \"helped lead America to the nationalism of Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\"[391] In the New Deal era, liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state.[392]\\n Schwartz argues that in the'),\n",

Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, \"What would Lincoln do?\"[393] However, Schwartz also finds that since World War II Lincoln\\'s symbolic power has lost relevance, and this \"fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness.\" He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.[394]\\n In the Cold War years Lincoln\\'s image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by Communist regimes.[392] He had long been known as the Great Emancipator,[395] but, by the late 1960s, some African American intellectuals, led by Lerone Bennett Jr., denied that Lincoln deserved that title.[396][397] Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968.[398] He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. Bennett argued that Lincoln opposed social equality and proposed that freed slaves voluntarily move to another country. The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government to emancipate them.[399] Defenders of Lincoln retorted that he was a \"moral visionary\" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible.[400] Brian Dirck stated that few Civil War scholars take Bennett (or Thomas DiLorenzo)[401] seriously, pointing to their \"narrow political agendas and faulty research\".[402]\\n By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives[403]—apart from neo-Confederates such as Mel Bradford, who denounced his treatment of the white South—for his intense nationalism, his support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of slavery, his acting on Lockean and Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers.[404] Lincoln became a favorite of liberal intellectuals across the world.[405]\\n Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln\\'s'),\n",

It was held from Monday, December 15, 1788, to Wednesday, January 7, 1789, under the new Constitution ratified that same year. George Washington was unanimously elected for the first of his two terms as president and John Adams became the first vice president. This was the only U.S. presidential election that spanned two calendar years without a contingent election and the first national presidential election in American history.\\n Under the Articles of Confederation, which were ratified in 1781, the United States had no head of state. The executive function of government remained with the legislative similar to countries that use a parliamentary system. Federal power, strictly limited, was reserved to the Congress of the Confederation whose \"President of the United States in Congress Assembled\" was also chair of the Committee of the States which aimed to fulfill a function similar to that of the modern Cabinet.\\n The Constitution created the offices of President and Vice President, fully separating these offices from Congress. The Constitution established an Electoral College, based on each state\\'s congressional representation, in which each elector would cast two votes for two candidates, a procedure modified in 1804 by the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment. States had varying methods for choosing presidential electors.[2] In five states, the state legislature chose electors. The other six chose electors through some form involving a popular vote, though in only two states did the choice depend directly on a statewide vote.\\n The enormously popular Washington was distinguished as the former Commander of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. After he agreed to come out of retirement, he was elected with ease unanimously; Washington did not select a running mate as that concept was not yet developed.\\n No formal political parties existed, though an informally organized consistent difference of opinion had already manifested between Federalists and Anti-Federalists. Thus, the contest for the vice-presidency was open. Thomas Jefferson predicted that a popular Northern leader such as Governor John Hancock of Massachusetts or John Adams, a former minister to Great Britain who had represented Massachusetts in Congress, would be elected vice president. Anti-Federalist leaders such as Patrick Henry, who did not run, and George Clinton, who had opposed ratification of the Constitution, also represented potential choices.\\n All 69 electors present cast one vote for Washington, making his election unanimous. Adams won 34 electoral votes and the vice presidency. The remaining 35 electoral votes were split among 10 candidates, including John Jay, who finished third with'),\n",

The remaining 35 electoral votes were split among 10 candidates, including John Jay, who finished third with nine electoral votes. Three states were ineligible to participate in the election: New York\\'s legislature did not choose electors on time, and North Carolina and Rhode Island had not ratified the constitution yet. Washington was inaugurated in New York City on April 30, 1789, 57 days after the First Congress convened.\\n \\n Candidates \\n [edit] Though no organized political parties yet existed, political opinion loosely divided between those who had more stridently and enthusiastically endorsed ratification of the Constitution, called Federalists or Cosmopolitans, and Anti-Federalists or Localists who had only more reluctantly, skeptically, or conditionally supported, or who had outright opposed ratification. Both factions supported Washington for president. Limited, primitive political campaigning occurred in states and localities where swaying public opinion might matter. For example, in Maryland, a state with a statewide popular vote, unofficial parties campaigned locally, advertising.\\n \\n Federalist candidates \\n [edit] \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tFormer Minister to the NetherlandsJohn Adamsfrom Massachusetts\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tSecretary of Foreign AffairsJohn Jayfrom New York\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tFormer GovernorJohn Rutledgeof South Carolina\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tGovernorJohn Hancockof Massachusetts\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tGovernorSamuel Huntingtonof Connecticut\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tLieutenant GovernorBenjamin Lincolnof Massachusetts\\n\\t\\t \\n Anti-Federalist candidates \\n [edit] \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tGovernorGeorge Clintonof New York\\n\\t\\t \\n General election \\n [edit] No nomination process existed at the time of planning, and thus, the framers of the Constitution presumed that Washington would be elected unopposed. For example, Alexander Hamilton spoke for national opinion when in a letter to Washington attempting to persuade him to leave retirement on his farm in Mount Vernon to serve as the first president, he wrote that \"...the point of light in which you stand at home and abroad will make an infinite difference in the respectability in which the government will begin its operations in the alternative of your being or not being the head of state.\"\\n Another uncertainty was the choice for the vice presidency, which contained no definite job description beyond being the president\\'s designated successor and presiding over the'),\n",

The Constitution stipulated that the position would be awarded to the runner-up in the presidential election. Because Washington was from Virginia, then the largest state, many assumed that electors would choose a vice president from a northern state. In an August 1788 letter, U.S. Minister to France Thomas Jefferson wrote that he considered John Adams and John Hancock, both from Massachusetts, to be the top contenders. Jefferson suggested John Jay, John Rutledge, and Virginian James Madison as other possible candidates.[3] Adams received 34 electoral votes, one short of a majority – because the Constitution did not require an outright majority in the Electoral College prior to ratification of the Twelfth Amendment to elect a runner-up as vice president, Adams was elected to that post.\\n Congress announced the procedure for the election on September 13, 1788, stipulating that all electors must be chosen on the first Wednesday in January (January 7, 1789), and that the electors must assemble to cast their votes for president and vice president on the first Wednesday in February (February 4).[4] However, the states differed in their interpretations of this procedure and of the relevant portions of the new Constitution. New Hampshire and Massachusetts held a popular vote for their presidential electors alongside the elections for their congressional representatives, on December 15 and December 18, respectively. In these two states, the legislatures ultimately chose the electors based on the voting results on the appointed day, January 7. In Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, the electors were chosen directly by the popular vote on January 7. In Connecticut, Georgia, and South Carolina, the electors were appointed by the legislature alone on January 7, while in New Jersey the governor and council selected them on that day. The legislature in New York was unable to agree on a method for choosing the electors before January 7, and so the state could not appoint any electors.[5]\\n Voter turnout comprised a low single-digit percentage of the adult population. Though all states allowed some rudimentary form of popular vote, only six ratifying states allowed any form of popular vote specifically for presidential electors. In most states only white men, and in many only those who owned property, could vote. Free black men could vote in four Northern states, and women could vote in New Jersey until 1804. In some states, there was a nominal religious test for voting. For example, in Massachusetts and Connecticut, the Congregational Church was established,\"),\n",

For example, in Massachusetts and Connecticut, the Congregational Church was established, supported by taxes. Voting was hampered by poor communications and infrastructure and the labor demands imposed by farming. Two months passed after the election before the votes were counted and Washington was notified that he had been elected president. Washington spent eight days traveling from Virginia to New York for the inauguration.[6] Congress took twenty-eight days to assemble.[7]\\n As the electors were selected, politics intruded, and the process was not free of rumors and intrigue. For example, Hamilton aimed to ensure that Adams did not inadvertently tie Washington in the electoral vote.[8] Also, Federalists spread rumors that Anti-Federalists plotted to elect Richard Henry Lee or Patrick Henry president, with George Clinton as vice president. However, Clinton received only three electoral votes.[9]\\n \\n Results \\n [edit] \\n Popular vote \\n [edit] Source: United States Presidential Elections, 1788-1860: The Official Results by Michael J.

The actual presidential candidates were rarely mentioned on tickets and voters were voting for particular electors who were pledged to a particular candidate. There was sometimes confusion as to who the particular elector was actually pledged to. Results are reported as the highest result for an elector for any given faction. For example, if three federalist electors received 100, 50, and 25 votes, federalist electors would be recorded as having 100 votes. Confusion surrounding the way results are reported may lead to discrepancies between the sum of all state results and national results.\\n In Maryland, the state was effectively split into two districts: the western shore and the eastern shore. Five electors were chosen from the western shore and three from the eastern shore. All electors, however, were elected at-large by all Maryland voters.[13]\\n In Delaware, no candidate received the majority of votes, throwing the election to the legislature, who chose the five best-performing elector candidates.[14]\\n Virginian electors John Pride and Patrick Henry had previously voted against ratification of the Constitution.[15] John Roane was one of three Clinton Electors.[16]\\n The vote totals of Virginia and Delaware appear to be incomplete. In several states candidates of unknown affiliation received votes.\\n \\n Electoral vote \\n [edit] Sixty-nine electors voted out of a possible 91: Two electors from Maryland and two from Virginia did not vote, the New York State Legislature was deadlocked and the state\\'s 8 electors were not appointed (see below), and North Carolina and Rhode Island with 7 and 3 electoral votes respectively had not yet ratified the Constitution. As per the terms of the unamended constitution, each elector was permitted two votes for president, with a majority of \"the whole number of electors appointed\" necessary to elect a president. Of the 69 participating electors, each cast one vote for Washington, who was elected president. Of the remaining candidates, only Adams, Jay, and Hancock received votes from more than one state; with 34 votes, Adams finished second behind only Washington, and by virtue of which fact was elected vice president.\\n Source: \"The Electoral College Count for the'),\n",

Federalists, backed by the great landed families and the city commercial interests, were the largest faction in the Senate, the smaller of the two chambers for which roughly a quarter of the state\\'s free white male population was eligible to vote; but in the House of Representatives, with its larger membership and electorate, Anti-federalists representing the middling interests held the majority. The fight to ratify the United States Constitution was still fresh in the memories of the legislators, and the Anti-Federalists were resentful for having been forced by events to accept the constitution without amendments. Bills to govern the selection of electors were proposed in each house and rejected by the other, leading to an impasse. The deadlock still stood on January 7, 1789, the last day for electors to be chosen by the states, and New York thus failed to appoint the eight electors allocated to it by the constitution.[23][24]\\n \\n Maps \\n [edit] \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tMap of presidential election results by county, shaded according to the vote share of the highest result for an elector of any given faction\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tMap of presidential election results by electoral district, shaded according to the vote share of the highest result for an elector of any given faction.

The 100th meridian west forms a great circle with the 80th meridian east.\\n In the United States, this meridian roughly marks the boundary between the semi-arid climate in the west and the humid continental and humid subtropical climates in the east and is used as shorthand to refer to that arid-humid boundary.\\n The meridian coincides with the approximate center of the continental United States, and is featured prominently on the cover of the Charter of the United Nations.\\n \\n From Pole to Pole \\n [edit] Starting at the North Pole and heading south to the South Pole, the 100th meridian west passes through:\\n \\n United States \\n [edit]  Texas Oklahoma  Union Pacific Railroad Nebraska Territory Cozad, Nebraska  Cozad, Nebraska In the United States the meridian 100° west of Greenwich forms the eastern border of the Texas panhandle with Oklahoma (which traces its origin to the Adams-Onís Treaty in 1819 which settled the border between New Spain and the United States between the Red River and Arkansas River).  Dodge City, Kansas lies exactly at the intersection of the Arkansas River and the 100th meridian.\\n As first noted by John Wesley Powell in the 1870s, there is a big difference in rainfall by the different sides of the meridian. In the central Great Plains, it roughly marks the western boundary of the normal reach of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, and the approximate boundary (although some areas do push the boundary slightly farther east) between the semi-arid climate to the west and the humid continental (north of about 37°N) and humid subtropical (south of about 37°N) climates to the east. West of the meridian, raising livestock is much more economically important than east of it, and what agriculture does exist relies heavily on irrigation. Historically, the meridian has often been taken as a rough boundary between the eastern and western United States. White settlement, spreading westward after the American Civil War, settled the area around this meridian during the 1870s.[citation needed'),\n",

It was hosted by the United States and took place from June 17 to July 17, 1994, at nine venues across the country. The United States was chosen as the host by FIFA on July 4, 1988.[1] Despite soccer's relative lack of popularity in the host nation, the tournament was the most financially successful[2][3] in World Cup history. It broke tournament records with overall attendance of 3,587,538 and an average of 68,991 per game,[4] figures that stand unsurpassed as of 2022,[5] despite the expansion of the competition from 24 to 32 teams starting with the 1998 World Cup.[6]\\n Brazil was crowned the winner after defeating Italy 3–2 in a penalty shootout at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, near Los Angeles, after the game had ended 0–0 after extra time. It was the first World Cup final to be decided on penalties. The victory made Brazil the first nation to win four World Cup titles. There were three new entrants in the tournament: Greece, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia; Russia also appeared as a separate nation for the first time, following the breakup of the Soviet Union, and for the first time since 1938, a unified Germany took part in the tournament. It was also the defending champion, but was eliminated in the quarterfinals by Bulgaria. It was the first World Cup where three points were awarded for a victory instead of two and also the first with the back-pass rule. This was done to encourage a more attacking style of soccer as a response to the criticism of the defensive tactics and low-scoring matches of the 1990 World Cup. This resulted in an average of 2.71 goals per match, compared to 2.21 in 1990.\\n \\n Background and preparations \\n [edit] \\n Bidding process \\n [edit] Three nations bid to host the event: United States,\\xa0Brazil, and\\xa0Morocco.[7] The vote was held in Zurich on July 4, 1988 (Independence Day in the United States), and only took one round with the United States bid receiving a little over half of the votes by the FIFA Executive Committee members.[7] FIFA hoped that by staging the world's most prestigious tournament there, it would lead to a growth of interest in the sport.[8]\\n An inspection committee also found that the proposed Brazilian\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_1994_FIFA_World_Cup.txt'}, page_content=\" a growth of interest in the sport.[8]\\n An inspection committee also found that the proposed Brazilian stadiums were deficient, while the Moroccan bid relied on the construction of nine new stadiums. Conversely, all the proposed stadiums in the United States were already built and fully functioning; U.S. Soccer spent $500\\xa0million preparing and organizing the tournament, far less than the billions other countries previously had spent and subsequently would spend on preparing for this tournament.[9] The U.S. bid was seen as the favorite and was prepared in response to losing the right to be the replacement host for the 1986 tournament following Colombia's withdrawal.[10]\\n One condition FIFA imposed was the creation of a professional soccer league – Major League Soccer was founded in 1993 and began operating in 1996.[11] There was some initial controversy[12] about awarding the World Cup to a country where soccer was not a nationally popular sport, and at the time, in 1988,[13] the U.S. no longer had a professional league; the North American Soccer League, established in 1967, had folded in 1984 after attendance faded.[12] The success of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, particularly the soccer tournament that drew 1.4\\xa0million spectators throughout the event, also contributed to FIFA's decision.[14]\\n The United States had previously bid to host the 1986 FIFA World Cup, after Colombia withdrew as the host nation in November 1982 because of economic concerns. Despite a presentation led by former North American Soccer League players Pelé and Franz Beckenbauer, as well as former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the executive committee selected Mexico.[15] There were proposals by FIFA to introduce larger goals and breaks after every quarter instead of just at halftime in order to appease U.S. television advertisers.[16][17][18] These proposals were met with resistance,[19] and ultimately rejected.\\n \\n Venues \\n [edit] The games were played in nine cities across the contiguous United States.[20] All stadiums had a capacity of at least 53,000  and were occupied by professional or college American football teams.[21]\\n Other host city candidates included Atlanta, Denver, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Miami, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Seattle, and Tampa, as well as smaller communities such as Annapolis, Maryland; Columbus, Ohio; Corvallis, Oregon; and New Haven, Connecticut.[22] Some sites, including Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami and Candlestick Park in San Francisco, were rejected because of\"),\n",

Stanford Stadium, 30 miles (48\\xa0km) southeast of San Francisco,[23][24] and the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Florida, were picked (the Miami Orange Bowl, another Miami venue, required major renovations to meet tournament standards).[25]\\n The Rose Bowl hosted the most matches with eight, four of them in the knockout stage, including the final. Giants Stadium hosted seven games including a semifinal; Foxborough Stadium, Stanford Stadium, and the Cotton Bowl hosted six games each, and Soldier Field, Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, and the Citrus Bowl hosted five games each. Pontiac Silverdome, the first indoor stadium used in a World Cup, hosted the least number of matches, four group-stage games. The Silverdome was also the only venue of the nine used that did not host knockout round games.[citation needed]\\n Because of the large area of the continental United States, the game locations were often far apart. Some teams in Groups A and B had to travel from Los Angeles or San Francisco to Detroit and back again, covering 2,300 miles (3,700\\xa0km) and four time zones.[citation needed] Teams in Groups C and D only played in Boston, Chicago, and Dallas—a trip from Boston to Dallas is 2,000 miles (3,200\\xa0km), but only covers two time zones; Chicago is in the same time zone as Dallas but is still 1,000 miles (1,600\\xa0km) away from both Dallas and Boston.[original research?] Teams in Groups E and F had it a bit easier[neutrality is disputed]—they played exclusively in East Coast cities and stayed in the same time zone.[citation needed] A few teams, such as Cameroon and Colombia, did not have to cross the country to play games.[original research?][clarification needed]\\n The variety of climates in different cities across the United States also sometimes made playing conditions challenging.[original research?] Aside from the oceanic coolness of Boston (Foxborough), the Mediterranean climate of San Francisco (Stanford), and occasionally the coolness of Chicago, as they had been in Mexico in 1970 and 1986 most matches were played in hot and/or humid conditions, thanks to nearly all of the games being scheduled to be played during the day instead of at night to suit a time difference compromise for television in Europe, Africa,'),\n",

United States midfielder Thomas Dooley described the Silverdome as \"the worst place I have ever played at\".[29]\\n Since the tournament, Pontiac Silverdome, Giants Stadium, and Foxboro Stadium have been demolished, and RFK Stadium is slated for demolition by 2023[needs update].[30] Stanford Stadium, the Cotton Bowl, the Citrus Bowl (now Camping World Stadium), and Soldier Field have all been moderately or heavily modified.[citation needed] The Rose Bowl is[when?] the only largely unmodified stadium used for this tournament.[citation needed]\\n \\n Participating teams and officials \\n [edit] \\n Qualification \\n [edit] 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification Three teams—one African, one Asian, and one European—made their debuts at the 1994 tournament.

In the European zone, Greece made its first World Cup appearance after topping a group from which Russia also qualified, competing independently for the first time after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\\n The defending champion, West Germany, was united with its East German counterpart, representing the unified Germany for the first time since the 1938 World Cup.

The nation of Czechoslovakia dissolved in 1993, completing its qualifying group under the name \"Representation of Czechs and Slovaks\" (RCS), but failed to qualify for the finals, having been edged out by Romania and Belgium in Group 4. Yugoslavia (which was supposed to play in Group 5) was suspended from international competition in 1992 as part of United Nations sanctions against the country as a result of the Yugoslav Wars. The sanctions were not lifted until 1994, by which time it was no longer possible for the team to qualify.

The remaining 18 teams were allocated into three pots based on geographical sections, with the: six qualified teams from Africa and Americas in pot 2, the top-6 ranked European teams in pot 3, while pot 4 comprised the 7th-10th best qualified European teams along with the two qualified Asian teams.\\n The principle of the draw was that each of the six drawn groups would have one team drawn respectively from pot 1, 2, 3 and 4; while respecting the following geographical limitations:\\n At least two European teams from UEFA in all groups, with one group having three European teams. United States and Mexico could not be drawn in the same group, because only one CONCACAF team per group.

As all qualified Asian teams from AFC were in pot 4, and all qualified African teams from CAF in pot 2, this automatically ensured only allowing maximum one Asian team and maximum one African team per group, as part of the normal draw procedure - without needing to observe special restricting sub-rules for them. The draw took place at the Las Vegas Convention Center and was televised live on December 19, 1993, on ESPN in the United States & Eurosport in all Europe with English language commentary on the latter channel by Scottish sportscaster Archie Macpherson.[37] The draw presenters were Dick Clark and Faye Dunaway. Ahead of the draw, the FIFA Organizing Committee had decided to allocate the top-seeded first group position A1 for the United States as the host, C1 for defending champion Germany, and E1 for the Italian team, which had requested to play most of its group matches at Giants Stadium in New York. The three other top-seeded teams would be located at the first position of either group B/D/F, with the decision largely depending on the identity of the other drawn group members for the seeded teams. Therefore, this last decision would only be made by a secret vote made by the FIFA Organizing Committee a few minutes after all teams had been drawn for all groups, and the decision would only be announced as the last step of the televised'),\n",

The six groups from A to F would play their group matches in the following nine cities:[38]\\n Group A and B played in Detroit, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Group C and D played in Chicago, Dallas, and Boston. Group E and F played in New York, Washington DC, and Orlando. Procedure for the draw:[39]\\n Pot 1 was used to draw the six top-seeded teams into the first position of the six groups designated by the colors green, orange, white, black, pink and blue. Group letters behind each color would only be decided by a following secret FIFA Organizing Committee vote, and only be revealed after the draw had been completed.

Pot 4 was used to draw one European/Asian team to each of six colored groups, with the draw conducted in the color order from left to right (green, orange, white, black, pink, blue).

Group letters behind each color (green, orange, white, black, pink and blue) would finally be decided by a final secret FIFA Organizing Committee vote, being announced as the last part of the televised event. The draw was officiated by FIFA general-secretary Sepp Blatter. Teams were drawn by German legend Franz Beckenbauer, heavyweight boxing champion Evander Holyfield and comedian and actor Robin Williams. Numbers for placement in the group were drawn by actor Beau Bridges, Women's World Cup champion Michelle Akers, model Carol Alt, artist Peter Max, racecar driver Mario Andretti and Olympic gold medalist in gymnastics Mary Lou Retton.[40][41][39]\\n \\n Results of the draw \\n [edit] In\"),\n",

After completion of the group stage, the best two teams in each group, as well as the four best-ranked third-place teams, advanced to the round of 16 in the knockout stage. This format was identical to the tournament structure used in 1986 and 1990 except that a win now earned three points instead of two, to encourage more attacking play.\\n \\n Summary \\n [edit] \\nThe format of the competition stayed the same as in the 1990 World Cup: 24 teams qualified, divided into six groups of four. Sixteen teams would qualify for the knockout phase: the six group winners, the six group runners-up, and the four third-placed teams with the best records. This was the last time this format was used, due to the expansion of the finals tournament in 1998 to 32 teams. FIFA introduced three rule changes for this tournament to encourage attacking play: three points awarded for a win in a group stage match instead of two, a relaxed offside rule and a ban on picking up back-passes to goalkeepers. The number of goals increased to 2.73 per game from the record-low of 2.21 in 1990.[42]\\n The tournament saw the end of Diego Maradona's World Cup career, having played in the 1982, 1986, and 1990 World Cups, and leading Argentina to the 1986 World Cup title and the final of the 1990 World Cup. Maradona was expelled from the tournament by FIFA after he failed a drug test that uncovered ephedrine, a weight-loss drug, in his blood. Colombia, despite high expectations due to their style and impressive qualifying campaign, failed to advance from the round robin. The team was dogged by influence from betting syndicates and drug cartels, with coach Francisco Maturana receiving death threats over squad selection.[43][44] After scoring an own goal for the United States and effectively eliminating Colombia from the competition, defender Andrés Escobar was shot to death on his return to Colombia outside a bar in a Medellín suburb 10 days later, possibly in retaliation for his mistake.[45]\\n  Lothar Matthäus Giants Stadium Bulgaria was one of the biggest surprises of the tournament.

The team won two of their three group games to qualify for the second round, where they advanced after a 3–1 penalty shootout win over Mexico. They then faced reigning world champions Germany in the quarterfinals, where goals from Stoichkov and Letchkov gave them a 2–1 victory.[46] Bulgaria went on to finish in fourth place after losing to Italy in the semifinals and Sweden in the third-place game.\\n The host nation United States, after a 23rd-place finish in the 1990 tournament, advanced to the second round as one of the best third-place teams. They were eliminated in the Round of 16 in a 1–0 defeat to Brazil on Independence Day.\\n Brazil's win over the hosts helped take them to the final against Italy. Brazil's path was relatively smooth as they never trailed over 270 minutes of the knockout stage, defeating the Netherlands in the quarterfinals and Sweden in the semis after the aforementioned win over the hosts. The Italians meanwhile had made hard work of reaching the final. During the group stage, Italy struggled and narrowly advanced to the next round, despite losing 1–0 to the Republic of Ireland. Italian playmaker Roberto Baggio, who as the reigning FIFA World Player of the Year and Ballon D'Or holder, was expected[by whom?] to be one of the stars of the tournament,[citation needed] had not yet scored a goal. During the Round of 16 games against Nigeria, Italy was trailing 1–0 in the dying minutes when Baggio scored the tying goal, forcing the game into extra time. He scored again with a penalty kick to send Italy through. Baggio carried the Italians from there, scoring the game-winning goal in the quarterfinal against Spain, and both goals in Italy's semifinal victory over Bulgaria.[47]\\n The third-place playoff was set between Bulgaria and Sweden, the team which scored more goals than any other in this World Cup with 15 over seven matches. These teams had also previously met in the qualifying group. Sweden won, 4–0. Swedish forward Tomas Brolin was named to the All-star team.[48]\\n The final game at the Rose Bowl was tense but devoid of scoring chances.

After four rounds, Brazil led 3–2, and Baggio, playing injured, had to score to keep Italy's hopes alive.[47] He missed by shooting it over the crossbar, and the Brazilians were crowned champions for the fourth time.[49] After the game ended, Vice President Al Gore hosted the awarding ceremony by handing Brazilian captain Dunga the prestigious trophy; the Brazil national team dedicated the title to the deceased Formula One motor racing champion and countryman Ayrton Senna, who had died two and a half months prior.[50]\\n The tournament's Golden Boot went jointly to Bulgaria's Stoichkov and Oleg Salenko of Russia, the latter becoming the first player to score five goals in a game, coming in a 6–1 victory against Cameroon. Both players scored six goals in the tournament. Brazilian striker Romário, with five goals, won the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player.[49]\\n Despite the controversy, the U.S. staged a hugely successful tournament, with an average attendance of nearly 70,000, surpassing the 1966 FIFA World Cup average attendance of 51,000, thanks to the large seating capacities of the stadiums in the United States in comparison to the generally smaller venues of Europe and Latin America. To this day, the total attendance for the final tournament of nearly 3.6 million remains the highest in World Cup history, despite the expansion of the competition from 24 to 32 teams at the 1998 World Cup in France.[5]\\n \\n Opening ceremony \\n [edit]  Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton The opening ceremony of the World Cup was held on June 17 at Chicago's Soldier Field. The ceremony was emceed by Oprah Winfrey, who introduced Diana Ross: she gave a musical performance. Ross was also intended to score a penalty at the beginning of her performance, with the goal then splitting in two as part of a pre-orchestrated stunt.[51] Instead, she kicked the ball wide to the left, missing the goal, but the goalposts collapsed anyway in accordance with the stunt plans. In addition, Daryl Hall and Jon Secada also gave musical performances.[52] It was officially opened by then-President Bill Clinton.[53]\\n \\n Group stage \\n [edit] Times are Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−4) (East Rutherford, Foxborough, Orlando, Pontiac and\"),\n",

Nigeria had been very impressive on their World Cup debut, and despite the narrow loss to Argentina, had emerged as group winners following victories against Bulgaria and Greece, the latter in which Nigeria doubled its lead late on a goal from Daniel Amokachi – a goal that would allow Nigeria to top its group. Maradona only played with Argentina during their first two games, both in Foxborough (playing Greece and Nigeria and scoring his last ever World Cup goal against the former); he was thrown out of the tournament after testing positive for ephedrine.\\n Having qualified for the tournament through a last-gasp goal against France, Bulgaria surprised many people, as the nation had never even won a game at the World Cup finals prior to this tournament. Despite losing its opening game 3–0 to Nigeria, Bulgaria came back in style with a 4–0 win over neighbor Greece (who had suffered exactly the same fate five days earlier against Argentina), and a 2–0 win against Argentina saw them advance.

All four teams even had the same goal difference. It began at Giants Stadium where Ray Houghton's chip ensured a shock Irish victory over the then-three-time champions Italy by 1–0, as well as gaining a measure of revenge for the previous World Cup, in which Italy both hosted and eliminated Ireland at the quarterfinal stage. The next day in Washington, Norway played its first World Cup game since 1938 and Kjetil Rekdal's goal five minutes from time proved decisive in an equally tense encounter as Norway beat Mexico.\\n In the second round of group play, Luis García's double had Mexico 2–0 up and in control of the game before a disagreement on the touchline resulted in fines for both Republic of Ireland's manager, Jack Charlton, and their striker John Aldridge. Aldridge was able to regain concentration in time to score six minutes from the end of the game to make it 2–1. Despite their loss, Aldridge's goal proved crucial to Ireland in the final group standings.\\n During the previous day at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Italy's World Cup hopes seemed to be diminishing fast as goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was sent off with the game still at 0–0. Yet despite this, Italy was still able to salvage an important 1–0 victory. Norway would ultimately pay a price for their inability to take advantage of Pagliuca's dismissal. With the four teams level on points, the final two group games would each have to finish as draws for things to stay that way.

The opening 2–1 victory against Saudi Arabia was followed by the 1–0 loss against Belgium before another 2–1 victory against Morocco, with Bryan Roy scoring the winner a mere 12 minutes from time, saw the Dutch win the group having scored more goals than Belgium and beaten Saudi Arabia.

The game between the United States and Switzerland at the Pontiac Silverdome on June 18 was the first to be played indoors in World Cup history: grass was grown by Michigan State University and was the first time since 1965 (the failed attempt at the Astrodome) that natural turf was used in an indoor stadium in the United States.

However, Milla remains the oldest outfield player to perform in the World Cup. For the first time, during the entering of the players onto the field, the FIFA Anthem, composed by Franz Lambert, was played. Gianluca Pagliuca of Italy became the first goalkeeper to be sent off in a World Cup game, dismissed for handling outside his area against Norway. Brazil's eleven goals in their seven games was a record for the lowest average goals scored per game for any World Cup-winning side, but this record was broken by Spain's eight goals in 2010. The three goals Brazil conceded in those seven games was at the time also the lowest average goals conceded per game, although this was subsequently surpassed by France in 1998, Italy in 2006, and Spain in 2010. The finals were the first time FIFA decided to experiment with the style of jerseys worn by officials, forgoing the traditional black. They could choose between burgundy, yellow or silver shirts depending on what was necessary to avoid a clash of colors with the two competing teams. This custom has since been followed, but with black shirts added as an option later. The finals were also the first time that players had their shirt numbers printed on the center front (or on the right or left breast, in Morocco's and Russia's case respectively) of the shirt, as well as their names printed on the back of their jerseys in a World Cup, just as other American sports did, to make their identification easier for sportscasters. This custom followed from Euro 92, and has continued ever since (although numbers printed on the center front had been experimented during the 1991 FIFA U-20 World Cup held in Portugal). The finals were the first to award 3 points for a win in the group stage to motivate teams to play an attacking style. In disciplinary matters, for the first time yellow cards accumulated in the group stage were wiped clean after its completion, and players started with a clean slate at the start of the knockout stage.

This was in response to the situation in 1990, where players such as Claudio Caniggia and Paul Gascoigne were suspended for the later games. The 1994 World Cup revolutionized television coverage of sports in the United States and then worldwide through the sponsored scoreboard and game clock that were constantly shown on screen throughout the game. Being fully privately-funded, television sports coverage in the United States had long relied upon commercial breaks, a feature suitable for sports such as baseball, basketball, ice hockey, and American football (which all have breaks in the action), but long considered incompatible with soccer, due to the long stretches of uninterrupted play. Led by Fox Sports, which debuted its NFL coverage about a month following the completion of the World Cup, virtually every television network included their version of the scoreboard clock by the decade's end. The 1994 World Cup final was the first (and to date only) goalless final in World Cup history. It was also the first to be decided by a penalty shootout, followed by the 2006 and 2022 finals. This was the last World Cup in which games other than the last two in each group were played simultaneously, although this only happened once in this tournament: Saudi Arabia vs. Morocco and Belgium vs. Netherlands in Group F. From France '98 onwards, each game in the first two rounds of group play and the whole knockout stage have been played separately to maximize television audiences. This was the last World Cup featuring 24 nations, and the last in which third-placed teams were still able to progress to the round of 16. From 1998 on, there were 32 nations, with only the top two in each group progressing. This was the first and the last World Cup in which both teams taking part in the third-place game, Sweden and Bulgaria, received bronze medals from FIFA, although only the winner was credited with finishing third. \\n See also \\n [edit] 1990s portal Sport portal Association football portal United States portal Soccer in the United States 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup – a first Women's World Cup hosted by the United States 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup – a second Women's World Cup hosted by the United States Copa América Centenario – First edition of the Copa América hosted within the United States 2024 Copa América – Second edition of the Copa América hosted within the United States 2026\"),\n",

Since 2021, ABC-Clio and its suite of imprints are collectively imprints of British publishing house Bloomsbury Publishing.\\n ABC-Clio provides service to fifteen different online databases which contain over one million online textbooks.[2] The company consults academic leaders in the fields they cover in order to provide authority for their reference titles.[3] The headquarters are located in Santa Barbara, California.\\n \\n History \\n [edit] ABC-Clio was founded in 1955 as a privately held corporation by Eric Boehm with its first publication, Historical Abstracts.[4] The name represents the company\\'s two original divisions when it incorporated in 1969: ABC stands for American Bibliographical Center and Clio Press is named after Clio, the muse of history from ancient Greek mythology. According to Boehm, he had always been interested in history so when he noticed that there were not many good historical abstracting services available, he started publishing the Historical Abstracts.[5]\\n During the 1960s, a sister bibliographic and abstract publication on American history was added, America: History and Life, which was considered an award-winning title. The company entered into digital publishing with electronic data in the 1960s and in 1975, it published its first online database[6] called DIALOG. During the 1980s, ABC-Clio expanded into providing primary reference books such as encyclopedias and dictionaries and stopped publishing bibliographic books.[5] \\n In the 1990s, ABC-Clio began to provide access to its humanities database on CD-ROM. The Exegy Current Events CD-ROM was named \"Best Disc of the Year\" by Library Journal.[4] In 1998, ABC-Clio provided electronic access to America: History and Life. By the 2000s, one of the company\\'s most popular products had become online databases for researching many topics in the field of the humanities. In 2001, ABC-Clio began to publish eBooks, initially providing 150 different titles to schools and libraries.[6] The company\\'s reference books had won numerous awards, and the company started a series of subject-related online databases for secondary school use. In 2004, the company acquired the quarterly historical journal, Journal of the West, which has been published since 1962.[4]'),\n",

The deal gave ABC-Clio a \"perpetual license\" to use the imprints of Greenwood Press and publish all of its titles. Acquiring the publishing group gave ABC-Clio access to Greenwood Press, Praeger Publishers, Praeger Security International and Libraries Unlimited.[11] Greenwood focuses on publishing full-text reference works which are authoritative on various topics.[12]\\n \\n Libraries Unlimited \\n [edit] Libraries Unlimited came to ABC-Clio as part of a deal with Greenwood Press. In 2012, Kathyrn Suárez was named Publisher for this division which focuses on publishing for librarians and information professionals.[12]\\n \\n ABC-Clio Solutions \\n [edit] ABC-Clio databases are provided under the umbrella of ABC-Clio Solutions. There are fifteen different databases providing access to different subject areas.[2] ABC-Clio Solutions provides digital curriculum with multimedia content, text-to-speech features, translation tools which covers various topics relating to history and the humanities.[13] After ABC-Clio acquired Greenwood Press\\'s databases, they revamped the look and feel of their interface in order to provide common access through the ABC-Clio interface.[14] ABC-Cl'),\n",

Praeger founded Frederick A. Praeger, Inc.[17] Originally publishing books by disillusioned former Communists who had fled from behind the Iron Curtain, the publishing house became known for publishing \"scholarly and professional books\" in the subject areas of social science and the humanities.[12]\\n In 1966 Praeger sold his firm to William B. Benton, an American senator and publisher and the chairman of Encyclopaedia Britannica.[17] In 1976 it was sold to CBS,[18] which had shortened the name to Praeger Publishing before selling it to Greenwood Press, Inc., in 1986.[18]\\n When the renamed Greenwood Publishing Group (GPG) was acquired by ABC-Clio in 2009,[19] Praeger Publishing became a standalone imprint of ABC-Clio, and remained such when, in December 2021, Bloomsbury Publishing bought ABC-Clio.[9]\\n \\n References \\n [edit] ^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\\\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\\'\"\"\\'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-'),\n",

The war led to the United States emerging predominant in the Caribbean region,[16] and resulted in U.S. acquisition of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. It also led to United States involvement in the Philippine Revolution and later to the Philippine–American War.\\n The 19th century represented a clear decline for the Spanish Empire, while the United States went from becoming a newly founded country to becoming a rising power. Spain's descent had begun in previous centuries, and accelerated during the Napoleonic invasion, which in turn triggered the independence of a large part of the American colonies.[17] Later political instability, including declarations of independence, revolutions, and civil wars, cost the country socially and economically. The U.S., on the other hand, expanded economically throughout that century by purchasing territories such as Louisiana and Alaska, militarily by actions such as the Mexican–American War, and by receiving large numbers of European immigrants. That process was interrupted only for a few years by the American Civil War and Reconstruction era.[18]\\n The main issue was Cuban independence. Revolts had been occurring for some years in Cuba against Spanish colonial rule. The United States backed these revolts upon entering the Spanish–American War. There had been war scares before, as in the Virginius Affair in 1873. But in the late 1890s, American public opinion swayed in support of the rebellion because of reports of concentration camps set up to control the populace.[19][20] Yellow journalism exaggerated the atrocities to further increase public fervor and to sell more newspapers and magazines.[21]\\n The business community had just recovered from a deep depression and feared that a war would reverse the gains. Accordingly, most business interests lobbied vigorously against going to war.[22] President William McKinley ignored the exaggerated news reporting and sought a peaceful settlement.[23] Though not seeking a war, McKinley made preparations in readiness for one. He unsuccessfully sought accommodation with Spain on the issue of independence for Cuba.[24] However, after the U.S. Navy armored cruiser Maine mysteriously exploded and sank in Havana Harbor on February 15, 1898, political pressures pushed McKinley into a war that he had wished to avoid.[25]\\n As far as Spain was concerned, there was a nationalist agitation, in which the written press had\"),\n",

On the same day, the United States Navy began a blockade of Cuba.[30] Both sides declared war; neither had allies.\\n The war was fought in both the Caribbean and the Pacific. American war advocates correctly anticipated that the United States\\' naval power would prove decisive, allowing expeditionary forces to disembark in Cuba against a Spanish garrison already facing nationwide Cuban insurgent attacks and further devastated by yellow fever.[31][32] The invaders obtained the surrender of Santiago de Cuba and Manila despite the good performance of Spanish infantry units, and fierce fighting for positions such as El Caney and San Juan Hill.[33] Madrid sued for peace after two Spanish squadrons were sunk in the battles of Santiago de Cuba and Manila Bay, and a third, modern, and significantly more powerful fleet was recalled home to protect the Spanish coasts.[34]\\n The war ended with the 1898 Treaty of Paris, negotiated on terms favorable to the United States. The treaty ceded ownership of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines from Spain to the United States and granted the United States temporary control of Cuba. The cession of the Philippines involved payment of $20\\xa0million ($730\\xa0million today) to Spain by the U.S. to cover infrastructure owned by Spain.[35]\\n The Spanish–American War brought an end to almost four centuries of Spanish presence in the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific.

Cánovas made clear in an address to the University of Madrid in 1882[38][39] his view of the Spanish nation as based on shared cultural and linguistic elements—on both sides of the Atlantic—that tied Spain\\'s territories together.\\n Cánovas saw Spanish colonialism as more \"benevolent\" than that of other European colonial powers. The prevalent opinion in Spain before the war regarded the spreading of \"civilization\" and Christianity as Spain\\'s main objective and contribution to the New World. The concept of cultural unity bestowed special significance on Cuba, which had been Spanish for almost four hundred years, and was viewed as an integral part of the Spanish nation. The focus on preserving the empire would have negative consequences for Spain\\'s national pride in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War.[40]\\n \\n American interest in the Caribbean \\n [edit] In 1823, the fifth American President James Monroe (1758–1831, served 1817–25) enunciated the Monroe Doctrine, which stated that the United States would not tolerate further efforts by European governments to retake or expand their colonial holdings in the Americas or to interfere with the newly independent states in the hemisphere. The U.S. would, however, respect the status of the existing European colonies. Before the American Civil War (1861–1865), Southern interests attempted to have the United States purchase Cuba and convert it into a new slave state. The pro-slavery element proposed the Ostend Manifesto of 1854. Anti-slavery forces rejected it.\\n After the American Civil War and Cuba\\'s Ten Years\\' War, U.S. businessmen began'),\n",

In 1894, 90% of Cuba\\'s total exports went to the United States, which also provided 40% of Cuba\\'s imports.[41] Cuba\\'s total exports to the U.S. were almost twelve times larger than the export to Spain.[42] U.S. business interests indicated that while Spain still held political authority over Cuba, it was the U.S. that held economic power over Cuba.\\n The U.S. became interested in a trans-isthmus canal in either Nicaragua or Panama and realized the need for naval protection. Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan was an exceptionally influential theorist; his ideas were much admired by future 26th President Theodore Roosevelt, as the U.S. rapidly built a powerful naval fleet of steel warships in the 1880s and 1890s. Roosevelt served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy from 1897 to 1898 and was an aggressive supporter of an American war with Spain over Cuban interests.\\n Meanwhile, the \"Cuba Libre\" movement, led by Cuban intellectual José Martí until he died in 1895, had established offices in Florida.[43] The face of the Cuban revolution in the U.S. was the \"Cuban Junta\", under the leadership of Tomás Estrada Palma, who in 1902 became Cuba\\'s first president. The Junta dealt with leading newspapers and Washington officials and held fund-raising events across the U.S. It funded and smuggled weapons. It mounted an extensive propaganda campaign that generated enormous popular support in the U.S. in favor of the Cubans. Protestant churches and most Democrats were supportive, but business interests called on Washington to negotiate a settlement and avoid war.[44]\\n Cuba attracted enormous American attention, but almost no discussion involved the other Spanish colonies of Puerto Rico, also in the Caribbean, or of the Philippines or Guam.[45] Historians note that there was no popular demand in the United States for an overseas colonial empire.[46]\\n \\n Path to war \\n [edit] \\n Cuban struggle for independence \\n [edit] Cuban War of Independence  Spanish La Campana de Gràcia Manuel Moliné Catalan The first serious bid for Cuban independence, the Ten Years\\' War, erupted in 1868 and was subdued by the authorities a decade later.

One such revolutionary, José Martí, continued to promote Cuban financial and political freedom in exile. In early 1895, after years of organizing, Martí launched a three-pronged invasion of the island.[47]\\n The plan called for one group from Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic led by Máximo Gómez, one group from Costa Rica led by Antonio Maceo Grajales, and another from the United States (preemptively thwarted by U.S. officials in Florida) to land in different places on the island and provoke an uprising. While their call for revolution, the grito de Baire, was successful, the result was not the grand show of force Martí had expected. With a quick victory effectively lost, the revolutionaries settled in to fight a protracted guerrilla campaign.[47]\\n Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, the architect of Spain\\'s Restoration constitution and the prime minister at the time, ordered General Arsenio Martínez-Campos, a distinguished veteran of the war against the previous uprising in Cuba, to quell the revolt. Campos\\'s reluctance to accept his new assignment and his method of containing the revolt to the province of Oriente earned him criticism in the Spanish press.[48]\\nThe mounting pressure forced Cánovas to replace General Campos with General Valeriano Weyler, a soldier who had experience in quelling rebellions in overseas provinces and the Spanish metropole. Weyler deprived the insurgency of weaponry, supplies, and assistance by ordering the residents of some Cuban districts to move to reconcentration areas near the military headquarters.[48] This strategy was effective in slowing the spread of rebellion. In the United States, this fueled the fire of anti-Spanish propaganda.[49] In a political speech, President William McKinley used this to ram Spanish actions against armed rebels. He even said this \"was not civilized warfare\" but \"extermination\".[50][51]\\n \\n Spanish attitude \\n [edit] Spain depended on Cuba for prestige and trade, and used it as a training ground for its army.

He was assassinated in 1897 by Italian anarchist Michele Angiolillo,[53] leaving a Spanish political system that was not stable and could not risk a blow to its prestige.[54]\\n \\n US response \\n [edit] Presidency of William McKinley The eruption of the Cuban revolt, Weyler\\'s measures, and the popular fury these events whipped up proved to be a boon to the newspaper industry in New York City. Joseph Pulitzer of the New York World and William Randolph Hearst of the New York Journal recognized the potential for great headlines and stories that would sell copies. Both papers denounced Spain but had little influence outside New York. American opinion generally saw Spain as a hopelessly backward power that was unable to deal fairly with Cuba. American Catholics were divided before the war began but supported it enthusiastically once it started.[55][56]\\n The U.S. had important economic interests that were being harmed by the prolonged conflict and deepening uncertainty about Cuba\\'s future. Shipping firms that had relied heavily on trade with Cuba now suffered losses as the conflict continued unresolved.[57] These firms pressed Congress and McKinley to seek an end to the revolt. Other American business concerns, specifically those who had invested in Cuban sugar, looked to the Spanish to restore order.[58] Stability, not war, was the goal of both interests. How stability would be achieved would depend largely on the ability of Spain and the U.S. to work out their issues diplomatically.\\n  Judge Columbia Uncle Sam Grant E. Hamilton Lieutenant Commander Charles Train, in 1894, in his preparatory notes in an outlook of an armed conflict between Spain and the United States, wrote that Cuba was solely dependent on the trade activities that Spain was carrying out and that it would mean Spain would use their \"entire forces\" to defend it.[59]\\n While tension increased among the Cubans and Spanish government, popular support of intervention began to spring up in the United States. Many Americans likened the Cuban revolt to the American Revolution, and they viewed the Spanish government as a tyrannical oppressor. Historian Louis Pérez notes that \"The proposition of war in behalf of Cuban independence took hold immediately and held on thereafter. Such was the sense of the public mood.\" Many poems and songs were written in the United States to express support of the \"Cuba Libre\" movement.[60]'),\n",

They saw it as a way to advance the cause of equality, service to country hopefully helping to gain political and public respect amongst the wider population.[61]\\n President McKinley, well aware of the political complexity surrounding the conflict, wanted to end the revolt peacefully. He began to negotiate with the Spanish government, hoping that the talks would dampen yellow journalism in the United States and soften support for war with Spain. An attempt was made to negotiate a peace before McKinley took office.  However, the Spanish refused to take part in the negotiations. In 1897 McKinley appointed Stewart L. Woodford as the new minister to Spain, who again offered to negotiate a peace. In October 1897, the Spanish government refused the United States\\' offer to negotiate between the Spanish and the Cubans, but promised the U.S. it would give the Cubans more autonomy.[62] However, with the election of a more liberal Spanish government in November, Spain began to change its policies in Cuba. First, the new Spanish government told the United States that it was willing to offer a change in the Reconcentration policies if the Cuban rebels agreed to a cessation of hostilities. This time the rebels refused the terms in hopes that continued conflict would lead to U.S. intervention and the creation of an independent Cuba.[62] The liberal Spanish government also recalled the Spanish Governor-General Valeriano Weyler from Cuba. This action alarmed many Cubans loyal to Spain.[63]\\n The Cubans loyal to Weyler began planning large demonstrations to take place when the next Governor General, Ramón Blanco, arrived in Cuba. U.S. consul Fitzhugh Lee learned of these plans and sent a request to the U.S. State Department to send a U.S. warship to Cuba.[63] This request led to the armored cruiser USS\\xa0Maine being sent to Cuba. While Maine was docked in Havana harbor, a spontaneous explosion sank the ship. The sinking of Maine was blamed on the Spanish and made the possibility of a negotiated peace very slim.[64] Throughout the negotiation process, the major European powers, especially Britain, France, and Russia, generally supported the American position and urged Spain to give in.[65] Spain repeatedly promised specific reforms that would pacify'),\n",

[67] McKinley sent USS Maine to Havana to ensure the safety of American citizens and interests, and to underscore the urgent need for reform. Naval forces were moved in position to attack simultaneously on several fronts if the war was not avoided. As Maine left Florida, a large part of the North Atlantic Squadron was moved to Key West and the Gulf of Mexico. Others were also moved just off the shore of Lisbon, and others were moved to Hong Kong too.[68]\\n At 9:40 P.M. on February 15, 1898, Maine sank in Havana Harbor after suffering a massive explosion. More than 3/4 of the ship's crew of 355 sailors, officers and Marines died as a result of the explosion. Of the 94 survivors only 16 were uninjured.[69] In total, 260[70] servicemen were killed in the initial explosion, six more died shortly thereafter from injuries,[70] marking the greatest loss of life for the American military in a single day since the defeat at Little Bighorn twenty-one years prior.[71]:\\u200a244\\u200a\\n While McKinley urged patience and did not declare that Spain had caused the explosion, the deaths of hundreds of American[72] sailors held the public's attention. McKinley asked Congress to appropriate $50\\xa0million for defense, and Congress unanimously obliged. Most American leaders believed that the cause of the explosion was unknown. Still, public attention was now riveted on the situation and Spain could not find a diplomatic solution to avoid war. Spain appealed to the European powers, most of whom advised it to accept U.S. conditions for Cuba in order to avoid war.[73] Germany urged a united European stand against the United States but took no action.[74]\\n The U.S. Navy's investigation, made public on March 28, concluded that the ship's powder magazines were ignited when an external explosion was set off under the ship's hull. This report poured fuel on popular indignation in the U.S., making war virtually inevitable.[75] Spain's investigation came to the opposite conclusion: the explosion originated within the ship.

Other investigations in later years came to various contradictory conclusions, but had no bearing on the coming of the war. In 1974, Admiral Hyman George Rickover had his staff look at the documents and decided there was an internal explosion.[76] A study commissioned by National Geographic magazine in 1999, using AME computer modeling, reported: \"By examining\\nthe bottom plating of the ship and how it bent and folded, AME concluded that the destruction could have been caused by a mine.\"[76]\\n \\n Declaring war \\n [edit] Propaganda of the Spanish–American War  Guardia Civil Caroline Mariana Islands Spanish Sahara Morocco Guinea Guam After Maine was destroyed, New York City newspaper publishers Hearst and Pulitzer decided that the Spanish were to blame, and they publicized this theory as fact in their papers.[77] Even prior to the explosion, both had published sensationalistic accounts of \"atrocities\" committed by the Spanish in Cuba; headlines such as \"Spanish Murderers\" were commonplace in their newspapers. Following the explosion, this tone escalated with the headline \"Remember The Maine, To Hell with Spain!\", quickly appearing.[78][79] Their press exaggerated what was happening and how the Spanish were treating the Cuban prisoners.[80] The stories were based on factual accounts, but most of the time, the articles that were published were embellished and written with incendiary language causing emotional and often heated responses among readers. A common myth falsely states that when illustrator Frederic Remington said there was no war brewing in Cuba, Hearst responded: \"You furnish the pictures and I\\'ll furnish the war.\"[81]\\n However, this new \"yellow journalism\" was uncommon outside New York City, and historians no longer consider it the major force shaping the national mood.[82] Public opinion nationwide did demand immediate action, overwhelming the efforts of President McKinley, Speaker of the House Thomas Brackett Reed, and the business community to find a negotiated solution. Wall Street, big business, high finance and Main Street businesses across the country were vocally opposed to war and demanded peace.[22] After years of severe depression, the economic outlook for the domestic economy was suddenly bright again in 1897. However, the uncertainties of warfare posed a serious threat to full economic recovery. \"War would impede the march of prosperity and put the country back many years,\" warned the New Jersey Trade Review. The leading railroad magazine editorialized, \"From a commercial and mercenary standpoint it seems peculiarly bitter that this war should come when the country'),\n",

Proctor concluded that war was the only answer.[85] Many in the business and religious communities which had until then opposed war, switched sides, leaving McKinley and Speaker Reed almost alone in their resistance to a war.[86][87][88] On April 11, McKinley ended his resistance and asked Congress for authority to send American troops to Cuba to end the civil war there, knowing that Congress would force a war.\\n  On April 19, while Congress was considering joint resolutions supporting Cuban independence, Republican Senator Henry M. Teller of Colorado proposed the Teller Amendment to ensure that the U.S. would not establish permanent control over Cuba after the war. The amendment, disclaiming any intention to annex Cuba, passed the Senate 42 to 35; the House concurred the same day, 311 to 6. The amended resolution demanded Spanish withdrawal and authorized the President to use as much military force as he thought necessary to help Cuba gain independence from Spain. President McKinley signed the joint resolution on April 20, 1898, and the ultimatum was sent to Spain.[29] In response, Spain severed diplomatic relations with the United States on April 21. On the same day, the U.S. Navy began a blockade of Cuba.[30] On April 23, Spain reacted to the blockade by declaring war on the U.S.[89]\\n On April 25, the U.S. Congress responded in kind, declaring that a state of war between the U.S. and Spain had de facto existed since April 21, the day the blockade of Cuba had begun.[30] It was the embodiment of the naval plan created by Lieutenant Commander Charles Train four years ago, stating once the US enacted a proclamation of war against Spain, it would mobilize its N.A'),\n",

(North Atlantic) squadron to form an efficient blockade in Havana, Matanzas and Sagua La Grande.[59]\\n The Navy was ready, but the Army was not well-prepared for the war and made radical changes in plans and quickly purchased supplies. In the spring of 1898, the strength of the U.S. Regular Army was just 24,593 soldiers. The Army wanted 50,000 new men but received over 220,000 through volunteers and the mobilization of state National Guard units,[90] even gaining nearly 100,000 men on the first night after the explosion of USS Maine.[91]\\n President McKinley issued two calls for volunteers, the first on April 23 which called for 125,000 men to enlist, followed by a second appeal for a further 75,000 volunteers.[92] States in the Northeast, Midwest, and the West quickly filled their volunteer quota. In response to the surplus influx of volunteers, several Northern states had their quotas increased. Contrastingly, some Southern states struggled to fulfil even the first mandated quota, namely Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.[93]\\n The majority of states did not allow African American men to volunteer which impeded recruitment in Southern states, especially those with large African American populations. Quota requirements, based on total population, were unmanageable, as they were disproportionate compared to the actual population permitted to volunteer.[94] This was especially evident in some states, such as Kentucky and Mississippi, which accepted out-of-state volunteers to aid in meeting their quotas.[95]\\n This Southern apprehension towards enlistment can also be attributed to \"a war weariness derived from the Confederacy\\'s defeat in the Civil War.\"[96] Many in the South were still recuperating financially after their losses in the Civil War, and the upcoming war did not provide much hope for economic prosperity in the South. The prospect of a naval war gave anxiety to those in the South. The financial security of those working and living in the cotton belt relied heavily upon trade across the Atlantic which would be disrupted by a nautical war, the prospect of which fostered a reluctance to enlist.[97] Potential volunteers were also not financially incentivized, with pay per month initially being $13.00 which then was then raised to $15.60 for combat pay.[98] It was more economically promising for most southern men to continue in their own enterprises rather than enlist'),\n",

McKinley put it succinctly in late 1897 that if Spain failed to resolve its crisis, the United States would see \"a duty imposed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization and humanity to intervene with force\".[50] Intervention in terms of negotiating a settlement proved impossible—neither Spain nor the insurgents would agree. Louis Perez states, \"Certainly the moralistic determinants of war in 1898 has been accorded preponderant explanatory weight in the historiography.\"[99] By the 1950s, however, American political scientists began attacking the war as a mistake based on idealism, arguing that a better policy would be realism. They discredited the idealism by suggesting the people were deliberately misled by propaganda and sensationalist yellow journalism. Political scientist Robert Osgood, writing in 1953, led the attack on the American decision process as a confused mix of \"self-righteousness and genuine moral fervor,\" in the form of a \"crusade\" and a combination of \"knight-errantry and national self- assertiveness.\"[100] Osgood argued:\\n [101] In his War and Empire,[31] Prof. Paul Atwood of the University of Massachusetts (Boston) writes:\\n The Spanish–American War was fomented on outright lies and trumped up accusations against the intended enemy.\\xa0...

The Spanish-speaking middle classes of the 19th century were mostly educated in the liberal ideas coming from Europe. Among these Ilustrados was the Filipino national hero José Rizal, who demanded larger reforms from the Spanish authorities. This movement eventually led to the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule. The revolution had been in a state of truce since the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato in 1897, with revolutionary leaders having accepted exile outside of the country.\\n Lt.

The Germans backed down.[116][118] At the time, the Germans expected the confrontation in the Philippines to end in an American defeat, with the revolutionaries capturing Manila and leaving the Philippines ripe for German picking.[119] The United States government had concerns about the self-government capability of the  Filipinos, fearing that a power such as Germany or Japan might take control if the United States did not do so.[120]\\n Commodore Dewey transported Emilio Aguinaldo, a Filipino leader who led rebellion against Spanish rule in the Philippines in 1896, from exile in Hong Kong to the Philippines to rally more Filipinos against the Spanish colonial government.[121] By June 9, Aguinaldo's forces controlled the provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Bataan, Zambales, Pampanga, Pangasinan, and Mindoro, and had laid siege to Manila.[122] On June 12, Aguinaldo proclaimed the independence of the Philippines.[123][124] While Aguinaldo's revolutionary forces were fighting, preparations were underway in the U.S. to send land forces to supplement Dewey's naval forces.[125] Troops began departing San Francisco on May 25 and arriving on Manila on June 30,[126] having been officially formed as the U.S. Army the U.S. Eighth Army Corps on June 21 while they were in transit.\\n On August 5, upon instruction from Spain, Governor-General Basilio Augustin turned over the command of the Philippines to his deputy,\"),\n",

This later led to the Philippine–American War,[130] which would prove to be more deadly and costly than the Spanish–American War.\\n The U.S. had sent a force of some 11,000 ground troops to the Philippines. On August 14, 1898, Spanish Captain-General Jaudenes formally capitulated and U.S. General Merritt formally accepted the surrender and declared the establishment of a U.S. military government in occupation. The capitulation document declared, \"The surrender of the Philippine Archipelago.\" and set forth a mechanism for its physical accomplishment.[131][132] That same day, the Schurman Commission recommended that the U.S. retain control of the Philippines, possibly granting independence in the future.[133] On December 10, 1898, the Spanish government ceded the Philippines to the United States in the Treaty of Paris. Armed conflict broke out between U.S. forces and the Filipinos when U.S. troops began to take the place of the Spanish in control of the country after the end of the war, quickly escalating into the Philippine–American War.\\n \\n Guam \\n [edit] Capture of Guam On June 20, 1898, the protected cruiser USS\\xa0Charleston commanded by Captain Henry Glass, and three transports carrying troops to the Philippines, entered Guam\\'s Apia Harbor. Captain Glass had opened sealed orders instructing him to proceed to Guam and capture it while en route to the Philippines. Charleston fired a few rounds at the abandoned Fort Santa Cruz without receiving return fire. Two local officials, not knowing that war had been declared and believing the firing had been a salute, came out to Charleston to apologize for their inability to return the salute as they were out of gunpowder.

While Assistant Secretary of the Navy, he placed the Navy on a war-time footing and prepared Dewey\\'s Asiatic Squadron for battle. He also worked with Leonard Wood in convincing the Army to raise an all-volunteer regiment, the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry. Wood was given command of the regiment that quickly became known as the \"Rough Riders\".[135]\\n The Americans planned to destroy Spain\\'s army forces in Cuba, capture the port city of Santiago de Cuba, and destroy the Spanish Caribbean Squadron (also known as the Flota de Ultramar). To reach Santiago they had to pass through concentrated Spanish defenses in the San Juan Hills and a small town in El Caney. The American forces were aided in Cuba by the pro-independence rebels led by General Calixto García.\\n \\n Cuban sentiment \\n [edit] For quite some time the Cuban public believed the United States government to possibly hold the key to its independence, and even annexation was considered for a time, which historian Louis Pérez explored in his book Cuba and the United States: Ties of Singular Intimacy. The Cubans harbored a great deal of discontent towards the Spanish government, a result of years of manipulation on the part of the Spanish. The prospect of getting the United States involved in the fight was considered by many Cubans as a step in the right direction. While the Cubans were wary of the United States\\' intentions, the overwhelming support from the American public provided the Cubans with some peace of mind, because they believed that the United States was committed to helping them achieve their independence.[136]\\n '),\n",

American Naval officers needed to destroy these cables to cut communications into and out of Cuba, in preparation for later operations against the major city of Santiago.[138] The USS\\xa0Marblehead and the USS\\xa0Nashville were dispatched to cut these cables early on the morning of May 11. To cut the cables, two steam cutters, with a crew of eight sailors and six Marines each, and two sailing launches, with a crew of fourteen sailors each, maneuvered into harbor and within 200 feet from shore.[138]\\n While the boats moved towards shore, the Marblehead and Nashville shelled Spanish trenches dug to protect the cables from sabotage attempts. They succeeded in destroying support buildings for the cables and drove the Spanish force back away from the beach. The boats' crews pulled one cable up and began trying to cut through its metal jacket while Spanish soldiers started firing from cover. Marine sharpshooters returned fire from the boats and the Marblehead and Nashville began firing shrapnel shells in an attempt to force the Spanish completely out of the area.[138] The sailors finished cutting one cable and pulled up a second one to begin severing it too. Spanish fire began to take a toll on the Marines and sailors with multiple casualties in the small boats, but the Americans were still able to cut a second wire. They began working on the final wire and succeeded in partially cutting it until the still heavy Spanish fire and mounting casualties forced the Navy officer in command, Lieutenant E. A. Anderson, to order the boats to return to the cover of the larger vessels.[138]\\n In the almost three hours of combat, two men were killed, two mortally wounded, and four more seriously wounded and they succeeded in severing two of the three cables running out of Cienfuegos.[139] This relatively brief fight significantly disrupted communications between Cuba, Santiago, and Spain and contributed to the overall American goal of isolating Cuba from outside support.

Shafter landed at Daiquirí and Siboney, east of Santiago, and established an American base of operations. A contingent of Spanish troops, having fought a skirmish with the Americans near Siboney on June 23, had retired to their lightly entrenched positions at Las Guasimas. An advance guard of U.S. forces under former Confederate General Joseph Wheeler ignored Cuban scouting parties and orders to proceed with caution. They caught up with and engaged the Spanish rearguard of about 2,000 soldiers led by General Antero Rubín[140] who effectively ambushed them, in the Battle of Las Guasimas on June 24. The battle ended indecisively in favor of Spain and the Spanish left Las Guasimas on their planned retreat to Santiago.\\n The U.S. Army employed Civil War–era skirmishers at the head of the advancing columns. Three of four of the U.S. soldiers who had volunteered to act as skirmishers walking point at the head of the American column were killed, including Hamilton Fish II (grandson of Hamilton Fish, the Secretary of State under Ulysses S. Grant), and Captain Allyn K. Capron, whom Theodore Roosevelt would describe as one of the finest natural leaders and soldiers he ever met. Only Oklahoma Territory Pawnee Indian, Tom Isbell, wounded seven times, survived.[141]\\n Regular Spanish troops were mostly armed with modern charger-loaded, 7mm 1893 Spanish Mauser rifles and using smokeless powder. The high-speed 7×57mm Mauser round was termed the \"Spanish Hornet\" by the Americans because of the supersonic crack as it passed overhead.

In later battles, state volunteers used the .45–70 Springfield, a single-shot black powder rifle.[141]\\n On July 1, a combined force of about 15,000 American troops in regular infantry and cavalry regiments, including all four of the army\\'s \"Colored\" Buffalo Soldier regiments, and volunteer regiments, among them Roosevelt and his \"Rough Riders\", the 71st New York, the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry, and 1st North Carolina, and rebel Cuban forces attacked 1,270 entrenched Spaniards in dangerous Civil War-style frontal assaults at the Battle of El Caney and Battle of San Juan Hill outside of Santiago.[142] More than 200 U.S. soldiers were killed and close to 1,200 wounded in the fighting, thanks to the high rate of fire the Spanish put down range at the Americans.[143] Charles A. Wikoff, a U.S. Army colonel who was killed in action, was the most senior U.S. Army officer killed in the Spanish–American War.[144] Supporting fire by Gatling guns was critical to the success of the assault.[145][146] Cervera decided to escape Santiago two days later. First Lieutenant John J. Pershing, nicknamed \"Black Jack\", oversaw the 10th Cavalry Unit during the war. Pershing and his unit fought in the Battle of San Juan Hill. Pershing was cited for his gallantry during the battle.\\n The Spanish forces at Guantánamo were so isolated by Marines and Cuban forces that they did not know that Santiago was under siege, and their forces in the northern part of the province could not break through Cuban lines. This was not true of the Escario relief column from Manzanillo,[citation needed] which fought its way past determined Cuban resistance but arrived too late to participate in the siege.\\n After the battles of San Juan Hill and El Caney, the American advance halted. Spanish troops successfully defended Fort Canosa, allowing them to stabilize their line and bar the entry to Santiago.

Once completed, these parapets were occupied by U.S. soldiers and a new set of excavations went forward. American troops, while suffering daily losses from Spanish fire, suffered far more casualties from heat exhaustion and mosquito-borne disease.[148] At the western approaches to the city, Cuban general Calixto Garcia began to encroach on the city, causing much panic and fear of reprisals among the Spanish forces.\\n \\n Battle of Tayacoba \\n [edit] Battle of Tayacoba Lieutenant Carter P. Johnson of the Buffalo Soldiers\\' 10th Cavalry, with experience in special operations roles as head of the 10th Cavalry\\'s attached Apache scouts in the Apache Wars, chose 50 soldiers from the regiment to lead a deployment mission with at least 375 Cuban soldiers under Cuban Brigadier General Emilio Nunez and other supplies to the mouth of the San Juan River east of Cienfuegos. On June 29, 1898, a reconnaissance team in landing boats from the transports Florida and Fanita attempted to land on the beach, but were repelled by Spanish fire. A second attempt was made on June 30, 1898, but a team of reconnaissance soldiers was trapped on the beach near the mouth of the Tallabacoa River. A team of four soldiers saved this group and were awarded Medals of Honor. The USS\\xa0Peoria and the recently arrived USS\\xa0Helena then shelled the beach to distract the Spanish while the Cuban deployment landed 40 miles east at Palo Alto, where they linked up with Cuban General Gomez.[149][150]\\n \\n Naval operations \\n [edit]   Iowa The major port of Santiago de Cuba was the main target of naval operations during the war. The U.S. fleet attacking Santiago needed shelter from the summer hurricane season; Guantánamo Bay, with its excellent harbor, was chosen. The 1898 invasion of Guantánamo Bay happened between June 6 and 10, with the first U.S. naval attack and subsequent successful landing of U.S. Marines with naval support.[151][152]\\n On April 23, a council of senior admirals of the Spanish Navy had decided to order Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete\\'s squadron of four armored cruisers and three torpedo boat destroyers to proceed from their present location in Cape Verde (having left from Cádiz,'),\n",

A two-month stand-off between Spanish and American naval forces followed.\\n U.S. Assistant Naval Constructor, Lieutenant Richmond Pearson Hobson had been ordered by Rear Admiral William T. Sampson to sink the collier USS\\xa0Merrimac in the harbor to bottle up the Spanish fleet. The mission was a failure, and Hobson and his crew were captured. They were exchanged on July 6, and Hobson became a national hero; he received the Medal of Honor, was advanced in grade and retired as a Naval Captain[k][154] He was elected in 1907 from Alabama to the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1934, his naval retirement rank was advanced to rear admiral.\\n The Battle of Santiago de Cuba on July 3, was the largest naval engagement of the Spanish–American War. When the Spanish squadron finally attempted to leave the harbor on July 3, the American forces destroyed or grounded five of the six ships. Only one Spanish vessel, the new armored cruiser Cristóbal Colón, survived, but her captain hauled down her flag and scuttled her when the Americans finally caught up with her. The 1,612 Spanish sailors who were captured and sent to Seavey\\'s Island at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, where they were confined at Camp Long as prisoners of war from July 11 until mid-September. The Americans treated Spain\\'s officers, soldiers, and sailors with great respect. Ultimately, Spanish prisoners were returned to Spain with their \"honors of war\" on American ships. Admiral Cervera received different treatment from the sailors taken to Portsmouth. For a time, he was held at Annapolis, Maryland, where he was received with great enthusiasm by the people of that city.[155]\\n \\n U.S. withdrawal \\n [edit] Yellow fever had quickly spread among the American occupation force, crippling it. A group of concerned officers of the American army chose Theodore Roosevelt to draft a request to Washington that it withdraw the Army, a request that paralleled a similar one from General Shafter, who described his force as an \"army of convalescents\".

The U.S. Army kept the black Ninth U.S. Cavalry Regiment in Cuba to support the occupation. The logic was that their race and the fact that many black volunteers came from southern states would protect them from disease; this logic led to these soldiers being nicknamed \"Immunes\". Still, when the Ninth left, 73 of its 984 soldiers had contracted the disease.[156]\\n \\n Puerto Rico \\n [edit] Puerto Rico campaign  Hormigueros, Puerto Rico On May 24, 1898, in a letter to Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge wrote, \"Porto Rico is not forgotten and we mean to have it\".[157]\\n In the same month, Lt. Henry H. Whitney of the United States Fourth Artillery was sent to Puerto Rico on a reconnaissance mission, sponsored by the Army\\'s Bureau of Military Intelligence. He provided maps and information on the Spanish military forces to the U.S. government before the invasion.\\n The American offensive began on May 12, 1898, when a squadron of 12 U.S. ships commanded by Rear Adm. William T. Sampson of the United States Navy attacked the archipelago\\'s capital, San Juan. Though the damage inflicted on the city was minimal, the Americans established a blockade in the city\\'s harbor, San Juan Bay. On June 22, the cruiser Isabel II and the destroyer Terror delivered a Spanish counterattack, but were unable to break the blockade and Terror was damaged.\\n The land offensive began on July 25, when 1,300 infantry soldiers led by Nelson A. Miles disembarked off the coast of Guánica. The first organized armed opposition occurred in Yauco in what became known as the Battle of Yauco.[citation needed]\\n This encounter was followed by the Battle of Fajardo. The United States seized control of Fajardo on August 1, but were forced to withdraw on August 5 after a group of 200 Puerto Rican-Spanish soldiers led by Pedro del Pino gained control of the city, while most civilian inhabitants fled to a nearby lighthouse.

On August 9, 1898, American troops that were pursuing units retreating from Coamo encountered heavy resistance in Aibonito in a mountain known as Cerro Gervasio del Asomante and retreated after six of their soldiers were injured. They returned three days later, reinforced with artillery units and attempted a surprise attack. In the subsequent crossfire, confused soldiers reported seeing Spanish reinforcements nearby and five American officers were gravely injured, which prompted a retreat order. All military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended on August 13, after U.S. President William McKinley and French ambassador Jules Cambon, acting on behalf of the Spanish government, signed an armistice whereby Spain relinquished its sovereignty over Puerto Rico.[158]\\n \\n Cámara's squadron \\n [edit]  Spanish East Asia Rescue Squadron [l] Shortly after the war began in April, the Spanish Navy ordered major units of its fleet to concentrate at Cádiz in Southern Spain, The objective was to form the 2nd Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Manuel de la Cámara y Livermoore.[159] Two of Spain's most powerful warships, the battleship Pelayo and the brand-new armored cruiser Emperador Carlos V, were not available when the war began—the former undergoing reconstruction in a French shipyard and the latter not yet delivered from her builders—but both were rushed into service and assigned to Cámara's squadron.[160] The squadron was ordered to guard the Spanish coast against raids by the U.S. Navy. No such raids materialized. U.S. Navy forces destroyed Montojo's squadron at Manila Bay on 1 May while Cámara's squadron lay idle at Cádiz and bottled up Cervera's squadron at Santiago de Cuba on 27 May.\\n During May, the Spanish Ministry of Marine considered options for employing Cámara's squadron.

Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence reported rumors as early as 15 May that Spain also was considering sending Cámara's squadron to the Philippines to destroy Dewey's squadron and reinforce the Spanish forces there with fresh troops.[162] Pelayo and Emperador Carlos V each were more powerful than any of Dewey's ships, and the possibility of their arrival in the Philippines was of great concern to the United States, which hastily arranged to dispatch 10,000 additional U.S. Army troops to the Philippines and send two U.S. Navy monitors to reinforce Dewey.[162]\\n  Cámara's squadron Suez Canal flagship battleship Pelayo armored cruiser Emperador Carlos V On 15 June, Cámara finally received orders to depart immediately for the Philippines. His squadron, made up of Pelayo (his flagship), Emperador Carlos V, two auxiliary cruisers, three destroyers, and four colliers, was to depart Cádiz escorting four transports. After detaching two of the transports to steam independently to the Caribbean, his squadron was to proceed to the Philippines, escorting the other two transports, which carried 4,000 Spanish Army troops to reinforce Spanish forces there. He then was to destroy Dewey's squadron.[163][161][164] Accordingly, he sortied from Cádiz on 16 June[165] and, after detaching two of the transports for their voyages to the Caribbean, passed Gibraltar on 17 June[163] and arrived at Port Said, at the northern end of the Suez Canal, on 26 June.[166] There he found that U.S. operatives had purchased all the coal available at the other end of the canal in Suez to prevent his ships from coaling with it.[167] He also received word on 29 June from the British government, which controlled Egypt at the time, that his squadron was not permitted to coal in Egyptian waters because to do so would violate Egyptian and British neutrality.[166][161]\\n Ordered to continue,[168] Cámara's squadron passed through the Suez Canal on 5–6 July.

No U.S. Navy forces subsequently threatened the coast of Spain, and Cámara and Spain\\'s two most powerful warships thus never saw combat during the war.[161]\\n \\n Making peace \\n [edit]  Jules Cambon With defeats in Cuba and the Philippines, and its fleets in both places destroyed, Spain sued for peace and negotiations were opened between the two parties. After the sickness and death of British consul Edward Henry Rawson-Walker, American admiral Dewey requested the Belgian consul to Manila, Édouard André, to take Rawson-Walker\\'s place as intermediary with the Spanish government.[170][171][172]\\n Hostilities were halted on August 12, 1898, with the signing in Washington of a Protocol of Peace between the United States and Spain.[173] After over two months of difficult negotiations, the formal peace treaty, the Treaty of Paris, was signed in Paris on December 10, 1898,[174] and was ratified by the United States Senate on February 6, 1899.\\n The United States gained Spain\\'s colonies of the Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico in the treaty, and Cuba became a U.S. protectorate.[174] The treaty came into force in Cuba April 11, 1899, with Cubans participating only as observers. Having been occupied since July 17, 1898, and thus under the jurisdiction of the United States Military Government (USMG), Cuba formed its own civil government and gained independence on May 20, 1902, with the announced end of USMG jurisdiction over the island. However, the U.S. imposed various restrictions on the new government, including prohibiting alliances with other countries, and reserved the right to intervene. The U.S. also established a de facto perpetual lease of Guantánamo Bay.[175][176][177]\\n \\n Aftermath \\n [edit]'),\n",

John Hay (the U.S. ambassador in London) boasted that it had been \"a splendid little war\".[178] The press showed Northerners and Southerners, blacks and whites fighting against a common foe, helping to ease the scars left from the American Civil War.[179] Exemplary of this was that four former Confederate States Army generals had served in the war, now in the U.S. Army and all of them again carrying similar ranks. These officers were Matthew Butler, Fitzhugh Lee, Thomas L. Rosser and Joseph Wheeler, though only the latter had seen action. Still, in an exciting moment during the Battle of San Juan Hill, Wheeler apparently forgot for a moment which war he was fighting, having supposedly called out \"Let\\'s go, boys! We\\'ve got the damn Yankees on the run again!\"[180]\\n The war marked American entry into world affairs. Since then, the U.S. has had a significant hand in various conflicts around the world, and entered many treaties and agreements. The Panic of 1893 was over by this point, and the U.S. entered a long and prosperous period of economic and population growth, and technological innovation that lasted through the 1920s.[181]\\n The war redefined national identity, served as a solution of sorts to the social divisions plaguing the American mind, and provided a model for all future news reporting.[182]\\n The idea of American imperialism changed in the public\\'s mind after the short and successful Spanish–American War. Because of the United States\\' powerful influence diplomatically and militarily, Cuba\\'s status after the war relied heavily upon American actions. Two major developments emerged from the Spanish–American War: one, it firmly established the United States\\' vision of itself as a \"defender of democracy\" and as a major world power, and two, it had severe implications for Cuban–American relations in the future. As historian Louis Pérez argued in his book Cuba in the American Imagination: Metaphor and the Imperial Ethos, the Spanish–American War of 1898 \"fixed permanently how Americans came to think of themselves: a righteous people given to the service of righteous purpose\".[183]\\n \\n Aftermath in Spain \\n [edit] Described as absurd and useless by much of historiography, the war against the United States was sustained by an internal logic, in the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Spanish%E2%80%93American_War.txt'}, page_content=' of historiography, the war against the United States was sustained by an internal logic, in the idea that it was not possible to maintain the monarchical regime if it was not from a more than predictable military defeat [28]  A similar point of view that is shared by Carlos Dardé: Once the war was raised, the Spanish government believed that it had no other solution than to fight, and lose. They thought that defeat —certain— was preferable to revolution —also certain—. [...] Granting independence to Cuba, without being defeated militarily... it would have implied in Spain, more than likely, a military coup d\\'état with broad popular support, and the fall of the monarchy; that is, the revolution [27] As the head of the Spanish delegation to the Paris peace negotiations, the liberal Eugenio Montero Ríos, said: \"Everything has been lost, except the Monarchy\". Or as the U.S. ambassador in Madrid said: the politicians of the dynastic parties preferred \"the odds of a war, with the certainty of losing Cuba, to the dethronement of the monarchy\".[184] There were Spanish officers in Cuba who expressed \"the conviction that the government of Madrid had the deliberate intention that the squadron be destroyed as soon as possible, in order to quickly reach peace[185]\".\\n Although there was nothing exceptional about the defeat in the context of the time (Fachoda incident, 1890 British Ultimatum, First Italo-Ethiopian War, Greco-Turkish War (1897), Century of humiliation, Russo-Japanese War\\xa0...\\xa0among other examples), in Spain the result of the war caused a national trauma due to the affinity of peninsular Spaniards with Cuba, but only in the intellectual class (which gave rise to Regenerationism and the Generation of \\'98), because the majority of the population was illiterate and lived under the regime of caciquismo.\\n The war greatly reduced the Spanish Empire. Spain had been declining as an imperial power since the early 19th century as a result of Napoleon\\'s invasion. Spain retained only a handful of overseas holdings: Spanish West Africa (Spanish Sahara), Spanish Guinea, Spanish Morocco, and the Canary Islands. With the loss of the Philippines, Spain\\'s remaining Pacific possessions in the Caroline Islands and Mariana Islands became untenable and were sold to Germany[186] in the German–Spanish Treaty (1899).\\n The Spanish soldier Julio Cervera Baviera, who served'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Spanish%E2%80%93American_War.txt'}, page_content='Spanish Treaty (1899).\\n The Spanish soldier Julio Cervera Baviera, who served in the Puerto Rican campaign, published a pamphlet in which he blamed the natives of that colony for its occupation by the Americans, saying, \"I have never seen such a servile, ungrateful country [i.e., Puerto Rico]\\xa0... In twenty-four hours, the people of Puerto Rico went from being fervently Spanish to enthusiastically American.... They humiliated themselves, giving in to the invader as the slave bows to the powerful lord.\"[187] He was challenged to a duel by a group of young Puerto Ricans for writing this pamphlet.[188]\\n Culturally, a new wave called the Generation of \\'98 originated as a response to this trauma, marking a renaissance in Spanish culture. Economically, the war benefited Spain, because after the war large sums of capital held by Spaniards in Cuba and the United States were returned to the peninsula and invested in Spain. This massive flow of capital (equivalent to 25% of the gross domestic product of one year) helped to develop the large modern firms in Spain in the steel, chemical, financial, mechanical, textile, shipyard, and electrical power industries.[189] However, the political consequences were serious. The defeat in the war began the weakening of the fragile political stability that had been established earlier by the rule of Alfonso XII.\\n A few years after the war, during the reign of Alfonso XIII, Spain improved its commercial position and maintained close relations with the United States, which led to the signing of commercial treaties between the two countries in 1902, 1906 and 1910. Spain would turn its attention to its possessions in Africa (especially northern Morocco, Spanish Sahara and Spanish Guinea) and would begin to rehabilitate itself internationally after the Algeciras Conference of 1906.[190] In 1907, it signed a kind of defensive alliance with France and the United Kingdom, known as the Pact of Cartagena in case of war against the Triple Alliance.[191] Spain improved economically because of its neutrality in the First World War.[192]\\n \\n Teller and Platt Amendments \\n [edit] The Teller Amendment was passed in the Senate on April 19, 1898, with a vote of 42 for versus 35 against. On April 20, it was passed by the House of Representatives with a vote of 311 for versus 6 against and signed into law by President William McKinley.[193] Effectively, it was a promise from the United States to the Cuban people'),\n",

The Platt Amendment, was a move by the United States' government to shape Cuban affairs to promote American interests without violating the Teller Amendment.[194]\\n The Platt Amendment granted the United States the right to stabilize Cuba militarily as needed.[195] It permitted the United States to deploy Marines to Cuba if Cuban freedom and independence were ever threatened or jeopardized by an external or internal force.[195] Passed as a rider to an Army appropriations bill which was signed into law on 2 March 1903, it effectively prohibited Cuba from signing treaties with other nations or contracting a public debt. It also provided for a permanent American naval base in Cuba.[195] Guantánamo Bay was established after the signing of the Cuban–American Treaty of Relations in 1903. The U.S. compelled Cuban assent by insinuating American forces would not be withdrawn otherwise.[citation needed] Thus, despite that Cuba technically gained its independence after the war ended, the United States government ensured that it had some form of power and control over Cuban affairs.[original research?]\\n \\n Aftermath in the United States \\n [edit] The U.S. annexed the former Spanish colonies of Puerto Rico, the Philippines and Guam.[195] The notion of the United States as an imperial power, with colonies, was hotly debated domestically with President McKinley and the Pro-Imperialists winning their way over vocal opposition led by Democrat William Jennings Bryan,[195] who had supported the war. The American public largely supported the possession of colonies, but there were many outspoken critics such as Mark Twain, who wrote The War Prayer in protest. Roosevelt returned to the United States a war hero,[195] and he was soon elected governor of New York and then became the vice president. At the age of 42, he became the youngest person to become president after the assassination of President McKinley.\\n The war served to further repair relations between the American North and South. The war gave both sides a common enemy for the first time since the end of the Civil War in 1865, and many friendships were formed between soldiers of northern and southern states during their tours of duty. This was an important development, since many soldiers in this war were the children of Civil War veterans on both sides.[196]\\n The African American community strongly supported the rebels in Cuba, supported entry into the war\"),\n",

Spokesmen noted that 33 African American seamen had died in the Maine explosion. The most influential Black leader, Booker T. Washington, argued that his race was ready to fight. War offered them a chance \"to render service to our country that no other race can\", because, unlike Whites, they were \"accustomed\" to the \"peculiar and dangerous climate\" of Cuba. One of the Black units that served in the war was the 9th Cavalry Regiment. In March 1898, Washington promised the Secretary of the Navy that war would be answered by \"at least ten thousand loyal, brave, strong black men in the south who crave an opportunity to show their loyalty to our land, and would gladly take this method of showing their gratitude for the lives laid down, and the sacrifices made, that Blacks might have their freedom and rights.\"[197]\\n \\n Veterans Associations \\n [edit] In 1904, the United Spanish War Veterans was created from smaller groups of the veterans of the Spanish–American War. The organization has been defunct since 1992 when its last surviving member Nathan E. Cook a veteran of the Philippine-American war died, but it left an heir in the Sons of Spanish–American War Veterans, created in 1937 at the 39th National Encampment of the United Spanish War Veterans.\\n The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW) was formed in 1914 from the merger of two veterans organizations which both arose in 1899: the American Veterans of Foreign Service and the National Society of the Army of the Philippines.[198] The former was formed for veterans of the Spanish–American War, while the latter was formed for veterans of the Philippine–American War. Both organizations were formed in response to the general neglect veterans returning from the war experienced at the hands of the government.\\n To pay the costs of the war, Congress passed an excise tax on long-distance phone service.[199] At the time, it affected only wealthy Americans who owned telephones. However, the Congress neglected to repeal the tax after the war ended four months later. The tax remained in place for over 100 years until, on August 1, 2006, it was announced that the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS would no longer collect it.[200]\\n \\n Impact on the Marine Corps \\n [edit] The U.S. Marine'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Spanish%E2%80%93American_War.txt'}, page_content=']\\n \\n Impact on the Marine Corps \\n [edit] The U.S. Marine Corps during the 18th and 19th centuries was primarily a ship-borne force. Marines were assigned to naval vessels to protect the ship\\'s crew during close quarters combat, man secondary batteries, and provide landing parties when the ship\\'s captain needed them.[201] During the Mexican–American War and the Civil War, the Marine Corps participated in some amphibious landings and had limited coordination with the Army and Navy in their operations.[202] During the Spanish–American War though, the Marines conducted several successful combined operations with both the Army and the Navy. Marine forces helped in the Army-led assault on Santiago and Marines also supported the Navy\\'s operations by securing the entrance to Guantanamo Bay so American vessels could clear the harbor of mines and use it as a refueling station without fear of Spanish harassment.[203] Doctrinally, the Army and the Navy did not agree on much of anything and Navy officers were often frustrated by the lack of Army support.[204] Having the Marine Corps alleviated some of this conflict because it gave Navy commanders a force \"always under the direction of the senior naval officer\" without any \"conflict of authority\" with the Army.[204]\\n The combined Marine Corps-Navy operations during the war also signaled the future relationship between the two services.[201] During the Banana Wars of the early 20th century, the island-hopping campaigns in the Pacific during World War II, and into modern conflicts America is involved in, the Marine Corps and Navy operate as a team to secure American interests. Thanks to the new territorial acquisitions of Guam, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Cuba, America needed the capabilities the Marines could provide.[201] The Spanish–American War was also the first time that the Marine Corps acted as America\\'s \"force in readiness\" because they were the first American force to land on Cuba. Being a \"body of troops which can be quickly mobilized and sent on board transports, fully equipped for service ashore and afloat\" became the Marine Corps\\' mission throughout the rest of the 20th century and into the 21st century.[204]\\n The Spanish–American War also served as a coming of age for several influential Marines. Lieutenants Smedley D. Butler, John A. Lejeune, and Wendell C. Neville and Captain George F. Elliott all served with distinction with the First Battalion that fought in Cuba.[137] Lieutenant Butler would go on to earn two Medals of Honor'),\n",

Lieutenants Lejeune and Neville and Captain Elliott would all become Commandants of the Marine Corps, the highest rank in the service and the leader of the entire Corps.\\n Marines\\' actions during the Spanish–American War also provided significant positive press for the Corps.[201] The men of the First Battalion were welcomed as heroes when they returned to the States and many stories were published by journalists attached to the unit about their bravery during the Battle of Guantanamo. The Marine Corps began to be regarded as America\\'s premier fighting force thanks in large part to the actions of Marines during the Spanish–American War and to the reporters who covered their exploits.[201] The success of the Marines also led to increased funding for the Corps from Congress during a time that many high-placed Navy officials were questioning the efficacy and necessity of the Marine Corps.[204] This battle for Congressional funding and support would continue until the National Security Act of 1947, but Marine actions at Guantanamo and in the Philippines provided a major boost to the Corps\\' status.[201]\\n \\n Aftermath in acquired territories \\n [edit] Article IX of The Treaty of Paris stated that the U.S. Congress were responsible for decisions regarding the civil and political rights of the indigenous populations of the newly acquired territories of  the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam. There was initial reluctance in Congress to set firm plans for the once-Spanish islands. The debate of whether to retain the islands or give them independence eventually became the core debating and campaigning issue of the 1900 election.[205] With McKinley\\'s victory, Congress began to pass legislation that marked the United States\\' \"deliberate turn toward imperialism.\"[206]\\n \\n Puerto Rico \\n [edit] In 1900, Congress enacted the Foraker Act, this established that Puerto Ricans would not have U.S. citizenship, despite being under U.S. sovereignty. Instead, the Act declared that they were only \"citizens of Porto Rico,\" and therefore, would not gain the civil, political, or constitutional rights that came with U.S. citizenship.[207] The Foraker Act also established a system of taxation. Puerto Ricans were required to pay tax to fund the imposed system of government, and goods imported from the U.S. to Puerto Rico had tariffs placed upon them.[208]\\n The Act implemented a new system of government in Puerto Rico, with the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Spanish%E2%80%93American_War.txt'}, page_content=' upon them.[208]\\n The Act implemented a new system of government in Puerto Rico, with the U.S. president holding the sole power to appoint the governor and upper legislative chamber. Puerto Ricans were able to elect the lower legislative chamber delegates and a resident commissioner to represent them in Washington, although the latter role had restricted influence, as it was as a non-voting representative.[209] Two political parties emerged, the Republicanos, co-founded by Frederico Degetau, and the Federales. The Republicanos\\' politics were strongly aligned with U.S. policies especially in comparison to the Federales. Before the election took place, the Federales decided to boycott the polls, this was in response to the favouritism displayed towards the Republicanos by U.S. officials. The Republicanos were subsequently elected, with Degetau becoming resident commissioner.[209]\\n The treatment of Puerto Rico was considered unconstitutional by some due to the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which declares that \"persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\"[210] In response to this, a series of court cases known as the Insular Cases took place, which sought to determine if the territories acquired in the War would be given U.S. citizenship or any constitutional rights. As a result of these cases, the Doctrine of Territorial Incorporation was established. This stated that the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam would be categorised as \"unincorporated\" territories and would \"not form part of the United States within the meaning of the Constitution.\"[211] This decree set a new precedent for how the U.S. government dealt with acquired territories, as they established a \"colonial formula\" in which they had total sovereignty over territories without been legally obligated to give rights to those they preside over.[212][213]\\n \\n Guam \\n [edit] The territory of Guam was placed under the control of the U.S. Navy Department. A naval base was upkept, with the commanders of the base acquiring the role of colonial governor who presided over all legislation and policies on the territory.[214]\\n \\n Postwar American investment in Puerto Rico \\n [edit] The change in sovereignty of Puerto Rico, like the occupation of Cuba, brought about major changes in both the insular and U.S. economies. Before 1898 the sugar industry in Puerto Rico was in decline for nearly half a century.[citation needed] In'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Spanish%E2%80%93American_War.txt'}, page_content=\" the sugar industry in Puerto Rico was in decline for nearly half a century.[citation needed] In the second half of the nineteenth century, technological advances increased the capital requirements to remain competitive in the sugar industry. Agriculture began to shift toward coffee production, which required less capital and land accumulation. However, these trends were reversed with U.S. hegemony. Early U.S. monetary and legal policies made it both harder for local farmers to continue operations and easier for American businesses to accumulate land.[215] This, along with the large capital reserves of American businesses, led to a resurgence in the Puerto Rican nuts and sugar industry in the form of large American owned agro-industrial complexes.\\n At the same time, the inclusion of Puerto Rico into the U.S. tariff system as a customs area, effectively treating Puerto Rico as a state with respect to internal or external trade, increased the codependence of the insular and mainland economies and benefitted sugar exports with tariff protection. In 1897, the United States purchased 19.6 percent of Puerto Rico's exports while supplying 18.5 percent of its imports. By 1905, these figures jumped to 84 percent and 85 percent, respectively.[216] However, coffee was not protected, as it was not a product of the mainland. At the same time, Cuba and Spain, traditionally the largest importers of Puerto Rican coffee, now subjected Puerto Rico to previously nonexistent import tariffs. These two effects led to a decline in the coffee industry. From 1897 to 1901, coffee went from 65.8 percent of exports to 19.6 percent while sugar went from 21.6 percent to 55 percent.[217] The tariff system also provided a protected market-place for Puerto Rican tobacco exports. The tobacco industry went from nearly nonexistent in Puerto Rico to a major part of the country's agricultural sector.[citation needed]\\n \\n In film and television \\n [edit]  USS\\xa0Olympia The Spanish–American War was the first U.S. war in which the motion picture camera played a role.[218] The Library of Congress archives contain many films and film clips from the war.[219] As good footage of fighting was difficult to capture, filmed reenactments using model ships and cigar smoke were shown on vaudeville screens.[220][221]\\n In addition, a few feature films have been made about the war.

It addresses issues of energy production, distribution, consumption, and modes of use, such as building codes, mileage standards, and commuting policies. Energy policy may be addressed via legislation, regulation, court decisions, public participation, and other techniques.\\n Federal energy policy acts were passed in 1974, 1992, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009,[1] 2020, 2021, and 2022, although energy-related policies have appeared in many other bills. State and local energy policies typically relate to efficiency standards and/or transportation.[2]\\n Federal energy policies since the 1973 oil crisis have been criticized for having an alleged crisis-mentality, promoting expensive quick fixes and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities.[3][4]\\n Americans constitute less than 5% of the world's population but consume 26% of the world's energy[5] to produce 26% of the world's industrial output. Technologies such as fracking and horizontal drilling allowed the United States to become the world's top oil fossil fuel producer in 2014.[6] In 2018, US exports of coal, natural gas, crude oil and petroleum products exceeded imports, achieving a degree of energy independence for the first time in decades.[7][8][9] In the second half of 2019, the US was the world's top producer of oil and gas.[10] This energy surplus ended in 2020.[11][12]\\n \\nVarious multinational groups have attempted to establish goals and timetables for energy and other climate-related policies, such as the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris Agreement. .mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none} \\n History \\n [edit] History of the petroleum industry in the United States History of coal mining in the United States  quad TWh   Grand Coulee Dam In the early days of the Republic, energy policy allowed free use of standing timber for heating and industry.

Wind and water provided energy for tasks such as milling grain. In the 19th century, coal became widely used. Whales were rendered into lamp oil.[13] Coal gas was fractionated for use as lighting and town gas. Natural gas was first used in America for lighting in 1816.[14] Since then, natural gas has grown in importance, especially for electricity generation. US natural gas production peaked in 1973,[15] and the price has risen significantly since then.\\n Coal provided the bulk of US energy needs well into the 20th century. Most urban homes had a coal bin and a coal-fired furnace. Over the years these were replaced with oil furnaces that were easier and safer to operate.[16]\\n From the early 1940s, the US government and the oil industry entered into a mutually beneficial collaboration to control global oil resources.[17] By 1950, oil consumption exceeded that of coal.[18][19] Abundant oil in California, Texas, Oklahoma, as well as in Canada and Mexico, coupled with its low cost, ease of transportation, high energy density, and use in internal combustion engines, led to its increasing use.[20]\\n Following World War II, oil heating boilers replaced coal burners along the Eastern Seaboard; diesel locomotives replaced coal-fired steam engines; oil-fired power plants dominated; petroleum-burning buses replaced electric streetcars, and citizens bought gasoline-powered cars. Interstate Highways helped make cars the major means of personal transportation.[20] As oil imports increased, US foreign policy was drawn into Middle Eastern politics, seeking to maintain a steady supply via actions such as protecting Persian Gulf sea lanes.[21]\\n Hydroelectricity was the basis of Nikola Tesla's introduction of the US electricity grid, which started at Niagara Falls, New York, in 1883.[22] Electricity generated by major dams, such as the TVA Project, Grand Coulee Dam and Hoover Dam, still produce some of the cheapest ($0.08/kWh) electricity. Rural electrification strung power lines to many more areas.[13][23]\\n A National Maximum Speed Limit of 55\\xa0mph (88\\xa0km/h) was imposed in 1974 (and repealed in 1995) to help reduce energy consumption. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (aka CAFE) standards were enacted in 1975 and progressively tightened over time to compel manufacturers to improve vehicle mileage.[24] Year-round Daylight Saving Time was imposed\"),\n",

The United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created in 1975.\\n The Weatherization Assistance Program[25] was enacted in 1977. On average, low-cost weatherization reduces heating bills by 31% and overall energy bills by $358 per year at 2012 prices. Increased energy efficiency and weatherization spending has a high return on investment.[26]\\n On August 4, 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed into law The Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977 (Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States)\\xa095–91, 91\\xa0Stat.\\xa0565, enacted August 4, 1977), which created the United States Department of Energy (DOE).[27] The new agency, which began operations on October 1, 1977, consolidated the Federal Energy Administration, the Energy Research and Development Administration, the Federal Power Commission, and programs of various other agencies. Former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger, who served under Presidents Nixon and Ford during the Vietnam War, was appointed as its first secretary.\\n On June 30, 1980, Congress passed the Energy Security Act, which reauthorized the Defense Production Act of 1950 and enabled it to cover domestic energy supplies. It also obligated the federal government to promote and reform the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, biofuels, geothermal power, acid rain prevention, solar power, and synthetic fuel commercialization.[28] The Defense Production Act was further reauthorized in 2009, with modifications requiring the federal government to promote renewable energy, energy efficiency, and improved grid and grid storage installations with its defense procurements.[29][30]\\n The federal government provided substantially larger subsidies to fossil fuels than to renewables in the 2002–2008 period. Subsidies to fossil fuels totaled approximately $72 billion, a direct cost to taxpayers, over the study period. Subsidies for renewable fuels totaled $29 billion over the same period.[31]\\n In some cases, the US used energy policy to pursue other international goals. Richard Heinberg claimed that a declassified CIA document showed that, during the Reagan administration, the US used oil prices as leverage against the Soviet Union economy by working with Saudi Arabia to keep oil prices low, thus decreasing the value of the USSR's petroleum export industry.[32]\\n The 2005 Energy Policy Act (EPA) addressed (1) energy efficiency; (2) renewable energy; (3) oil and gas; (4) coal; (5) tribal energy; (\"),\n",

The act also created the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant and set the CAFE standard to 35 mpg by 2020.\\n In February 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was passed, with an initial projection of $45 billion in funding levels going to energy. $11 billion went to the Weatherization Assistance Program, the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant, and the State Energy Program; $11 billion went to federal buildings and vehicles; $8 billion went to research and development programs; $2.4 billion went to new technology and facility development projects; $14 billion went to the electric grid; and $21 billion was projected to go to tax credits for renewable energy and electric vehicles, among other things.[35] Due in part to the design of the tax credits, the final amount of energy spending and incentives reached over $90 billion, leveraged $150 billion in private investment, funded 180 advanced manufacturing projects, and created more than 900,000 job-years.[36]\\n In December 2009, the United States Patent and Trademark Office announced the Green Patent Pilot Program.[37] The program was initiated to accelerate the examination of patent applications relating to certain green technologies, including the energy sector.[38] The pilot program was initially designed to accommodate 3,000 applications related to certain green technology categories, and the program was originally set to expire on December 8, 2010. In May 2010, the USPTO announced that it would expand the pilot program.[39]\\n In 2016, federal government energy-specific subsidies and support for renewables, fossil fuels, and nuclear energy amounted to $6,682 million, $489 million and $365 million, respectively.[40]\\n On June 1, 2017, then-President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would cease participation in the 2015 Paris Agreement on\"),\n",

The bill contains increased incentives for energy efficiency (particularly in federal government buildings), improved funding for weatherization assistance, standards to phase out the use of hydrofluorocarbons, plans to rebuild the nation's energy research sector including fossil fuel research, and $7 billion in demonstration projects for carbon capture and storage.[45][46][47]\\n Under President Joe Biden, one-third of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was tapped to reduce energy prices during the COVID-19 pandemic.[48] He also invoked the Defense Production Act to boost manufacturing of solar cells, renewable energy generators, fuel cells, electricity-dependent clean fuel equipment, building insulation, heat pumps, critical power grid infrastructure, and electric vehicle batteries.[49][50]\\n Biden also signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to invest $73 billion in the energy sector.[51] $11 billion of that amount will be invested in power grid infrastructure, with the first selected recipients for $3.46 billion announced in October 2023. This is the largest investment in the grid since the Recovery Act.[52] $6 billion will go to domestic nuclear power. From the $73 billion, the IIJA will invest $45 billion in innovation and industrial policy for key emerging technologies in energy; $430 million[53] to $21 billion in new demonstration projects at the DOE; and nearly $24 billion in onshoring, supply chain resilience, and bolstering competitive advantages in energy, divided into an $8.6 billion investment in carbon capture and storage, $3 billion in battery material reprocessing, $3 billion in battery recycling, $1 billion in rare-earth minerals stockpiling, and $8 billion in new research hubs for green hydrogen.[54] $4.\"),\n",

The group has also catalyzed over $537.4 billion in public infrastructure spending, which includes $70.2 billion in energy aside from tax credits in the IRA.[68]\\n Even so, the Biden administration also presided over record high oil and gas production, reaching averages of 12.9 million barrels per day nationwide in 2023,[69] and 530,000 barrels per day from public lands since 2020 (despite a campaign pledge to halt drilling on said lands). However, growth has been driven more by Permian Basin drilling than by the administration's policies.[70]\\n Around spring 2024, the Biden administration announced several changes to its energy policy approach. First, the EPA issued new tailpipe emissions limits that it projected would cut emissions by 7 billion metric tons, or 56% of 2026 levels, by 2032.[71] Second, it raised royalty rates from 12.5% to 16.7%, doubled rents and increased lease bond minimums by a factor of 15 on federal lands for oil and gas companies.[72] Third, the EPA finalized new standards for power plant carbon emissions, projecting cuts of 65,000 tons by 2028 and 1.38 billion tons by 2047.[73] Fourth, the DOE announced\"),\n",

Since that year, crude exports have skyrocketed nearly 600% to 3.2 million barrels per day in 2020, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.[83]\\n Under President Biden, the pattern continued, as hundreds of other new oil and gas projects, many of them marked for boosting exports to counter China and Russia's influence, were approved.[84][85] In response to criticism from environmentalists, Biden temporarily suspended regulatory approvals for new natural gas export terminals in January 2024,[86] but in July, Louisiana federal judge James D.

A survey from 2018 estimated that the largest energy users were the chemical industry (30%), petroleum and coal processing (18%), mining (9%) and paper (9%).[90]\\n The most energy-intensive industry was by far petroleum and coal, at over 30 billion BTU per employee. The paper industry was second at 6.5 billion BTU per employee. Each of these handles energy sources as part of their raw materials (fossil fuels and wood).[91] The same survey found that half of the electric use was to drive machines and about 10% each for heating, cooling and electro-chemical processes. Most of the remainder was for factory lighting and HVAC. About half of the natural gas was for process heating, and most of the rest was for boilers.[92]\\n Transportation used 28% of energy, almost all of which was petroleum and other fuels.

While transmission lines and distribution services are still provided by local utility companies, wholesale markets were created to enable power plant investments and allow utilities to acquire power for customers. Those wholesale markets are operated by regional transmission organizations (RTOs).[106]\\n Deregulation led to the creation of independent energy suppliers and allowed customers to choose their electric supplier.\\n \\n Energy efficiency \\n [edit] Efficient energy use Opportunities for increased energy efficiency are available across the economy, including buildings/appliances, transportation, and manufacturing. Some opportunities require new technology. Others require behavioral change by individuals or at the community level or above.\\n The U.S. federal government has initiated various energy-efficiency policies, programs and legislation, including the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), CAFE standards for vehicle fuel efficiency, and the Energy Star program for promoting efficiency in household appliances. American governments, at all levels, have implemented various building standards to improve energy efficiency.[107]\\n Building-related energy efficiency innovation takes many forms, including improvements in water heaters; refrigerators and freezers; building control technologies for heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC); adaptive windows; building codes; and lighting.[108]\\n Energy-efficient technologies can enable superior performance. For example, this could include higher quality lighting, heating and cooling with greater controls, or improved reliability of service through greater ability of utilities to respond to time of peak demand.[108]\\n More efficient vehicles save on fuel purchases, emit fewer pollutants, improve health and save on medical costs.[108]\\n Heat engines are only 20% efficient at converting oil into work.[109][110] However, heat pumps are highly efficient, up to 300% in some cases, at moving heat to and from outside air.[111]\\n \\n Energy budget, initiatives and incentives \\n [edit] List of United States Energy Acts Energy subsidies in the United States Most energy policy incentives are financial. Examples of these include tax breaks, tax reductions, tax exemptions, rebates, loans and subsidies.\\n The Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, and the Inflation Reduction Act all provided such incentives.\\n \\n Tax incentives \\n [edit] Tax credit §\\xa0Renewable Energy/Invest'),\n",

The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) reduces federal income taxes for qualified tax-payers based on capital investment in renewable energy projects. The Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit (MTC) awards tax credits to selected domestic manufacturing facilities that support clean energy development.[112]\\n \\n Loan guarantees \\n [edit] The Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program guarantees financing up to 80% of a qualifying project's cost.[34]\\n \\n Renewable energy \\n [edit]  Shepherds Flat Wind Farm megawatt Oregon  Desert Sunlight Solar Farm  Ivanpah Solar Power Facility  San Joaquin Valley  Tesla Roadster (2008) lithium ion In the United States, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation has grown to 21% by 2020.[113] Oil use is expected to decline in the US because of increasing vehicle efficiency and replacement of crude oil by natural gas as a feedstock for the petrochemical sector. One forecast is that the rapid uptake of electric vehicles will reduce oil demand drastically by 80% lower in 2050 compared with today.[114]\\n A Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) is a state/local mandate that requires electricity providers to supply a minimum amount of power from renewable sources, usually defined as a percentage of total energy production.[115]\\n \\n Biofuels \\n [edit] The federal government offers many programs to support the development and implementation of biofuel-based replacements for fossil fuels.[116]\\n Landowners and operators who establish, produce, and deliver biofuel crops may qualify for partial reimbursement of startup costs as well as for annual payments.[116] Loan guarantees help finance development, construction, and retrofitting of commercial-scale biorefineries. Grants help build demonstration-scale biorefineries and also help scale up existing biorefineries. Loan guarantees and grants support the purchase of pumps that dispense ethanol-including fuels.[116]\\n Production support helps makers expand output.[116] Tax credits support the purchase of fueling equipment (gas pumps) for specific fuels including some biofuels.[116]\\n Education grants support training the public about biodiesel.[116] Research, development, and demonstration grants support feedstock development and biofuel development.[116] Grants support research,\"),\n",

The volume of leases has varied by presidential administration. During the first 19 months of the Joe Biden administration, 130,000 acres were leased, compared to 4 million under the Donald Trump administration, 7 million under the Obama administration, and 13 million under the George W. Bush administration.[118]\\n The Inflation Reduction Act requires that for federal lands, oil and gas auctions be carried out before wind and solar lease consideration, even as the Act brought about royalty rate increases.[119] Permian Basin drilling activity, some of it on federal lands, also brought about record high oil production even after the Act's signing in 2022.[70]\\n \\n Net metering \\n [edit] Net metering in the United States [edit]  Net metering is a policy by many states in the United States designed to help the adoption of renewable energy. Net metering was pioneered in the United States as a way to allow solar and wind to provide electricity whenever available and allow use of that electricity whenever it was needed, beginning with utilities in Idaho in 1980, and in Arizona in 1981.[120] In 1983, Minnesota passed the first state net metering law.[121] As of March 2015, 44 states and Washington, D.C. have developed mandatory net metering rules for at least some utilities.[122] However, although the states' rules are clear, few utilities actually compensate at full retail rates.[123]\\n Energy Policy Act of 2005 public electric utilities [124] [125] \\n Electricity transmission and distribution \\n [edit] North American power transmission grid transcluded Federal Energy Regulatory Commission#History (edit | history)  North American Electric Reliability Corporation Electric power transmission results in energy loss, through electrical resistance, heat generation, electromagnetic induction and less-than-perfect electrical insulation.[126] Electric transmission (production to consumer) loses over 23% of the energy due to generation, transmission, and distribution.[127] In\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Energy_policy_of_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=') loses over 23% of the energy due to generation, transmission, and distribution.[127] In 1995, long distance transmission losses were estimated at 7.2% of the power transported.[128] Reducing transmission distances reduces these losses. For every five units of energy going into typical large fossil fuel power plants, only about one unit reaches the consumer in a usable form.[129]\\n A similar situation exists in natural gas transport, which requires compressor stations along pipelines that use energy to keep the gas moving. Gas liquefaction, cooling, and re-gasification in the liquified natural gas supply chain uses a substantial amount of energy.\\n Distributed generation and distributed storage are means of reducing total and transmission losses as well as reducing costs for electricity consumers.[130][131][132]\\n In October 2023, the Biden administration announced the largest major investment in the grid since the Recovery Act in 2009.[133][134]\\n The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is the primary regulatory agency of electric power transmission and wholesale electricity sales within the United States. FERC was originally established by Congress in 1920 as the Federal Power Commission and has since undergone multiple name and responsibility modifications. Electric power distribution and the retail sale of power is under state jurisdiction.\\n \\n Order No. 888 \\n [edit] Order No.\\xa0888 was adopted by FERC on April 24, 1996. It was \"designed to remove impediments to competition in the wholesale bulk power marketplace and to bring more efficient, lower cost power to the Nation\\'s electricity consumers. The legal and policy cornerstone of these rules is to remedy undue discrimination in access to the monopoly owned transmission wires that control whether and to whom electricity can be transported in interstate commerce.\"[135] The Order required all public utilities that own, control, or operate facilities used for transmitting electric energy in interstate commerce, to have open-access non-discriminatory transmission tariffs. These tariffs allow any electricity generator to utilize existing power lines to transmit the power that they generate. The Order also permits public utilities to recover the costs associated with providing their power lines as an open-access service.[135]\\n \\n Energy Policy Act of 2005 \\n [edit] The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) expanded federal authority to regulate power transmission. EPAct gave FERC significant new responsibilities, including enforcement of electric transmission reliability standards and the establishment of rate incentives to encourage investment in electricity transmission.[136]\\n Historically, local governments exercised authority over the grid and maintained significant disincentives for actions that'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Energy_policy_of_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=\"]\\n Historically, local governments exercised authority over the grid and maintained significant disincentives for actions that would benefit other states. Localities with cheap electricity have a disincentive for making interstate commerce in electricity trading easier, since other regions would be able to compete for that energy and drive up rates. For example, some regulators in Maine refused to address congestion problems because the congestion protects Maine rates.[137]\\n Local constituencies can block or slow permitting by pointing to visual impacts, as well as to environmental and health concerns. In the US, generation is growing four times faster than transmission, but transmission upgrades require the coordination of multiple jurisdictions, complex permitting, and cooperation between the many companies that collectively own the grid. The US national security interest in improving transmission was reflected in the EPAct, which gave the Department of Energy the authority to approve transmission if states refused to act.[138]\\n \\n Order No. 1000 \\n [edit] In 2010, FERC issued Order 1000, which required RTOs to create regional transmission plans and identify transmission needs based on public policy. Cost allocation reforms were included, possibly to reduce barriers faced by non-incumbent transmission developers.[139]\\n \\n Order No. 841 \\n [edit] In February 2018, FERC issued Order 841, which required wholesale markets to open up to individual storage installations, regardless of interconnection point (transmission, distribution or behind-the-meter).[140][141] The Order was challenged in court by the state public utility commissions via the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), the American Public Power Association, and others who claimed that FERC overstepped its jurisdiction by regulating how local electric distribution and behind-the-meter facilities are administered, i.e., by not providing an opt-out of wholesale market access for energy storage facilities located at the distribution level or behind-the-meter. The D.C. Circuit Court issued an order in July 2020 that upheld Order 841 and dismissed the petitioners' complaints.[142][143][144]\\n \\n Order No. 2222 \\n [edit] FERC issued Order 2222 on September 17, 2020, enabling distributed energy resources such as batteries and demand response to participate in regional wholesale electricity markets.[145][146] Market operators submitted initial compliance plans by early 2022.[147] The Supreme Court had ruled in 2016 in FERC v. Electric Power Supply Ass'n that the agency had the authority to regulate demand response transactions.[148]\\n \\n Infrastructure\"),\n",

The investment is the largest in the American grid since the Recovery Act 14 years earlier. According to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, the projects could enable 35 gigawatts of renewable energy to come online by 2030 and 400 microgrids to be built.[133][134] On August 6, 2024, the DOE announced the recipients of the next $2.2 billion in GRIP grants, eight grid innovation projects across 18 states adding a total of 13 gigawatts of capacity to the grid.[152]\\n On October 30, the DOE announced the results of a mandated triennial study that, for the first time in its history, included anticipation of future grid transmission needs; the Act had explicitly required this inclusion. The study found a decline in infrastructure investments since 2015 and consistently high prices in the Rust Belt and California since 2018. The study projected a 20 to 128 percent increase in transmission would be needed within regions, while interregional transmission would need to increase by 25 to 412 percent. The study found that the most potential was in better connecting Texas to the Southwest region, the Mississippi Delta and Midwest regions to the Great Plains region, and New York to New England.[150][153][149]\\n The DOE also announced the first three recipients of a new $2.5 billion loan program called the Transmission Facilitation Program (TFP), created to provide funding to help build up the interstate power grid. They are the 1.2-gigawatt Twin States Clean Energy Link between Quebec, New Hampshire and Vermont; the 1.5-gigawatt Cross-Tie Transmission Line between Utah and Nevada; and the 1-gigawatt Southline Transmission Project between Arizona and New Mexico.[151][149] The following April 25, the DOE announced the TFP selection of the 2\"),\n",

Grid developers had a deadline of January 12, 2024 to apply.[155][156]\\n \\n Inflation Reduction Act \\n [edit] The Inflation Reduction Act of the Biden administration has fast-tracked transmission projects by helping purchase $30 billion in wholesale electric transmission contracts, as well as by publishing a national transmission needs report, which had been expanded in scope by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.[157] The Act provides $760 million to states, tribes and localities to accelerate planning approvals for high-voltage interstate transmission lines; the first $371 million was awarded on July 24, 2024.[158]\\n Even with the IRA, U.S. transmission grid capacity would have to triple in order to meet the global target of net zero carbon emissions according to a Princeton University study.[159][160]\\n \\n Order No. 2023 \\n [edit] On July 28, 2023, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved Order No. 2023, which regulates the interconnection process that ties renewables projects into the large-scale grid. Among other provisions, the rule requires transmission planners to consolidate projects into \\'clusters\\' for regulatory approval purposes on a \\'first-ready, first-served\\' basis that prioritizes the most well-studied and fully financed projects. It also requires transmission planners to forecast advanced technologies and allow for multiple projects to share a new single interconnection point. It \"imposes firm deadlines and penalties if transmission providers fail to complete interconnection studies on time\".[161]\\n \\n Coordinated Interagency Transmission Authorizations and Permits; NEPA reform \\n [edit] The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 required the federal government to implement a two-year deadline for permitting approvals for energy projects, including grid transmission, and also to designate a lead agency for such projects.\\n On April 25, 2024, the DOE finalized a rule to implement the requirement. The rule, called  Coordinated Interagency Transmission Authorizations and Permits, stated the DOE would assume the role of default lead agency for most new power transmission projects.

The rule also stated that the DOE would streamline permitting approvals, require only one environmental impact statement per project, and increase transparency around the permitting process.[74]\\n On the same day, the DOE authorized changes to its categorical exclusion process under the National Environmental Policy Act, allowing faster permit reviews for grid battery storage, flywheel storage, reconductoring and advanced power flow control, and midsize solar PV projects.[162]\\n \\n Order Nos. 1920 and 1977 \\n [edit] On May 13, 2024, FERC issued Order Nos. 1920 and 1977. The former order requires utilities to plan 20 years in advance to anticipate future regional (though not interregional) transmission needs, with five-year updates, and to cooperate in creating a default cost-sharing plan to deliver to state regulators. It \"provides for cost-effective expansion of transmission that is being replaced, when needed, known as \\'right-sizing\\' transmission facilities\", and it allows states more opportunities to cooperate with utility companies and energy project developers, while preventing states that benefit from regional transmission projects from not paying for them.[163][164][165]\\n The latter order affirms FERC\\'s siting authority in National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors if a state regulatory agency denies any of its own siting responsibility thereof, thus implementing part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The order creates an Applicant Code of Conduct to encourage proper landowner outreach and adds air quality, environmental justice and tribal engagement reports to the list of requirements for project applicants.[166]\\n \\n Greenhouse gas emissions \\n [edit] Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States Kyoto Protocol  [167]  CO2 emissions per capita While the United States has cumulatively emitted the most greenhouse gases of any country, it represents a declining fraction of ongoing emissions, long superseded by China.[168][169] Since its peak in 1973, per capita US emissions have declined by 40%, resulting from improved technology, the shift in economic activity from manufacturing to services, changing consumer preferences and government policy.[170]\\n State and local government have launched initiatives. Cities in 50 states endorsed the Kyoto protocol.[171] Northeastern US states established the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI),[172] a state-level emissions cap and trade program.\\n On February 16, 2007, the United States, together with leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom,'),\n",

They envisaged a global cap-and-trade system that would apply to both industrialized nations and developing countries.[173][174] The system did not come to pass.\\n Arjun Makhijani argued that in order to limit global warming to 2\\xa0°C, the world would need to reduce CO2 emissions by 85% and the US by 95%.[175][176][177] He developed a model by which such changes could occur. Effective delivered energy is modeled to increase from about 75 quadrillion BTU in 2005 to about 125 quadrillion in 2050,[178] but due to efficiency increases, the actual energy input increases from about 99 quadrillion BTU in 2005 to about 103 quadrillion in 2010 and then will decrease to about 77 quadrillion in 2050.[179] Petroleum use is assumed to increase until 2010 and then linearly decrease to zero by 2050. The roadmap calls for nuclear power to decrease to zero, with the reduction also beginning in 2010.[180]\\n Joseph Romm called for the rapid deployment of existing technologies to decrease carbon emissions. He argued that \"If we are to have confidence in our ability to stabilize carbon dioxide levels below 450 p.p.m. emissions must average less than [5 billion metric tons of carbon] per year over the century. This means accelerating the deployment of the 11 wedges so they begin to take effect in 2015 and are completely operational in much less time than originally modeled by Socolow and Pacala.\"[181]\\n In 2012, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory assessed the technical potential for renewable electricity for each of the 50 states. It concluded that each state had the technical potential for renewable electricity, mostly from solar and wind, that could exceed its current electricity consumption. The report cautions: \"Note that as a technical potential, rather than economic or market potential, these estimates do not consider availability of transmission infrastructure, costs, reliability or time-of-dispatch, current or future electricity loads, or relevant policies.\"[182]\\n In 2022, the EPA received funding for a green bank called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to drive down carbon dioxide emissions, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest decarbonization incentives package in U.S. history.[60][61] The Fund will'),\n",

Harvard. The Court held that affirmative action programs \"lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points. We have never permitted admissions programs to work in that way, and we will not do so today\".[12][13][14]\\n \\n History \\n [edit] \\n Summary \\n [edit] The modern history begins in 1961 when President John F. Kennedy in 1961 issued Executive Order 10925, which required government contractors to take \"affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\"[15] Affirmative action then evolved into a complex system of group preferences which would face many legal challenges. Affirmative action included the use of racial quotas until the Supreme Court ruled that quotas were unconstitutional in 1978.[16] Affirmative action currently tends to emphasize not specific quotas but rather \"targeted goals\" to address past discrimination in a particular institution or in broader society through \"good-faith efforts ... to identify, select, and train potentially qualified minorities and women.\"[2][17] For example, many higher education institutions have voluntarily adopted policies which seek to increase recruitment of racial minorities.[18][page\\xa0needed] Outreach campaigns, targeted recruitment, employee and management development, and employee support programs are examples of affirmative action in employment.[19] Nine states in the United States have banned race-based affirmative action: California (1996), Washington (1998, rescinded 2022[20]), Florida (1999'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=' affirmative action: California (1996), Washington (1998, rescinded 2022[20]), Florida (1999), Michigan (2006), Nebraska (2008), Arizona (2010), New Hampshire (2012), Oklahoma (2012), and Idaho (2020). Florida\\'s ban was via an executive order and New Hampshire and Idaho\\'s bans were passed by the legislature. The other six bans were approved at the ballot.[21] The 1996 Hopwood v. Texas decision effectively barred affirmative action in the three states within the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit—Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas—until Grutter v. Bollinger abrogated it in 2003.[22]\\n Affirmative action policies were developed to address long histories of discrimination faced by minorities and women, which reports suggest produced corresponding unfair advantages for whites and males.[23][24] They first emerged from debates over non-discrimination policies in the 1940s and during the civil rights movement.[25] These debates led to federal executive orders requiring non-discrimination in the employment policies of some government agencies and contractors in the 1940s and onward, and to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibited racial discrimination in firms with over 25 employees. The first federal policy of race-conscious affirmative action was the Revised Philadelphia Plan, implemented in 1969, which required certain government contractors to set \"goals and timetables\" for integrating and diversifying their workforce. Similar policies emerged through a mix of voluntary practices and federal and state policies in employment and education. Affirmative action as a practice was partially upheld by the Supreme Court in Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), while the use of racial quotas for college admissions was ruled unconstitutional in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978).[a] In Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (2023), the Supreme Court majority ruled that race-based affirmative action in college admissions violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, with concurrences highlighting race-based affirmative action\\'s violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.\\n Affirmative action remains controversial in American politics. Supporters claim that it promotes equality and representation for groups which are socioeconomically disadvantaged or have faced historical discrimination or oppression and counteracts continuing bias and prejudice against women and minorities. Supporters also point to contemporary examples of conscious and unconscious biases, such as the finding that job-seekers with African American sounding names may be less likely to get a callback than those with white-sounding names, as proof that affirmative action is not obsolete.[17]['),\n",

The idea was called the \"Forty acres and a mule\" policy.[30]  The proposal was controversial because it would reverse the policy of peaceful reunion between North and South.  Congress never approved. Sherman\\'s military orders were soon revoked by President Andrew Johnson. Requiring private construction firms to hire Blacks on public housing projects funded by the Public Works Administration (PWA) was an innovative New Deal policy in the 1930s. About 13% of these new hires were Black, but the policy was not publicized and ended by 1941.[31]   In the 1950s and 1960s, the discussion of policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. Civil rights guarantees that came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment affirmed the civil rights of people of color.[32]\\n \\n Presidential administrations \\n [edit] \\n Roosevelt (1933–1945) \\n [edit] The first appearance of the term \\'affirmative action\\' was in the National Labor Relations Act, better known as the Wagner Act, of 1935.[18]:\\u200a15\\u200a Proposed and championed by U.S. Senator Robert F. Wagner, Democrat of New York, the Wagner Act was in line with President Franklin D. Roosevelt\\'s goal of providing economic security to workers and other low-income groups.[33] During this time period it was not uncommon'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=' security to workers and other low-income groups.[33] During this time period it was not uncommon for employers to blacklist or fire employees associated with unions. The Wagner Act allowed workers to unionize without fear of being discriminated against, and empowered a National Labor Relations Board to review potential cases of worker discrimination. In the event of discrimination, employees were to be restored to an appropriate status in the company through \\'affirmative action\\'.[34] While the Wagner Act protected workers and unions it did not protect minorities, who, exempting the Congress of Industrial Organizations, were often barred from union ranks.[18]:\\u200a11\\u200a This original coining of the term therefore has little to do with affirmative action policy as it is seen today, but helped set the stage for all policy meant to compensate or address an individual\\'s unjust treatment.[35]\\n FDR\\'s New Deal programs often contained equal opportunity clauses stating \"no discrimination shall be made on account of race, color or creed\".[18]:\\u200a11\\u200a  No enforcement was attempted outside the PWA housing projects. FDR\\'s largest contribution to affirmative action, however, lay in his Executive Order 8802 of 1941 which prohibited discrimination in the defense industry or government.[18]:\\u200a22\\u200a The executive order promoted the idea that if taxpayer funds were accepted through a government contract, then all taxpayers should have an equal opportunity to work through the contractor.[18]:\\u200a23–4\\u200a To enforce this idea, Roosevelt created the  Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) with the power to investigate hiring practices by government contractors.[18]:\\u200a22\\u200a\\n \\n Truman (1945–1953) \\n [edit] Following the Sergeant Isaac Woodard incident, President Harry S. Truman, himself a combat veteran of World War I, issued Executive Order 9808[36] establishing the President\\'s Committee on Civil Rights to examine the violence and recommend appropriate federal legislation. Hearing of the incident, Truman turned to NAACP leader Walter Francis White and declared, \"My God! I had no idea it was as terrible as that. We\\'ve got to do something.\" In 1947 the committee published its findings, To Secure These Rights. The book was widely read, influential, and considered utopian for the times: \"In our land men are equal, but they are free to be different. From these very differences among our people has come the great human and national strength of America.\" The report discussed and demonstrated racial discrimination in basic freedoms, education, public facilities, personal safety, and employment'),\n",

The committee was disturbed by the state of race relations, and included the evacuation of Americans of Japanese descent during the war \"made without a trial or any sort of hearing...Fundamental to our whole system of law is the belief that guilt is personal and not a matter of heredity or association.\" The recommendations were radical, calling for federal policies and laws to end racial discrimination and bring about equality: \"We can tolerate no restrictions upon the individual which depend upon irrelevant factors such as his race, his color, his religion, or the social position to which he is born.\" To Secure These Rights set the liberal legislative agenda for the next generation that eventually would be signed into law by Lyndon B. Johnson.[18]:\\u200a35–36\\u200a\\n To Secure These Rights also called for desegregation of the Armed Forces. \"Prejudice in any area is an ugly, undemocratic phenomenon, but in the armed services, where all men run the risk of death, it is especially repugnant.\" The rationale was fairness: \"When an individual enters the service of the country, he necessarily surrenders some of the rights and privileges which are inherent in American citizenship.\" In return, the government \"undertakes to protect his integrity as an individual.\" Yet that was not possible in the segregated Army, since \"any discrimination which...prevents members of the minority groups from rendering full military service in defense of their country is for them a humiliating badge of inferiority.\" The report called for an end to \"all discrimination and segregation based on race, color, creed, or national origins in...all branches of the Armed Services.\"[18]:\\u200a38–39\\u200a\\n In 1947 Truman and his advisors came up with a plan for a large standing military, called Universal Military Training, and presented it to Congress. The plan opposed all segregation in the new post-war Armed Forces: \"Nothing could be more tragic for the future attitude of our people, and for the unity of our nation\" than a citizens\\' military that emphasized \"class or racial difference.\"[18]:\\u200a39–40\\u200a\\n On February 2, 1948, President Truman delivered a special message to Congress. It consisted of ten objectives that Congress should focus on when enacting legislation. Truman concluded by saying, \"If we wish to inspire the peoples of the world whose freedom is in jeopardy, if we wish to restore hope to those who have already'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=' of the world whose freedom is in jeopardy, if we wish to restore hope to those who have already lost their civil liberties, if we wish to fulfill the promise that is ours, we must correct the remaining imperfections in our practice of democracy.\"[37]\\n In June, Truman became the first president to address the NAACP. His speech was a significant departure from traditional race relations in the United States. In front of 10,000 people at the Lincoln Memorial, the president left no doubt where he stood on civil rights. According to his speech, America had \"reached a turning point in the long history of our country\\'s efforts to guarantee freedom and equality to all our citizens...Each man must be guaranteed equality of opportunity.\" He proposed what black citizens had been calling for – an enhanced role of federal authority through the states. \"We must make the Federal government a friendly, vigilant defender of the rights and equalities of all Americans. And again I mean all Americans.\"[18]:\\u200a40\\u200a\\n On July 26, Truman mandated the end of hiring and employment discrimination in the federal government, reaffirming FDR\\'s order of 1941.[18]:\\u200a40\\u200a He issued two executive orders on July 26, 1948: Executive Order 9980 and Executive Order 9981. Executive Order 9980, named Regulations Governing for Employment Practices within the Federal Establishment, instituted fair employment practices in the civilian agencies of the federal government. The order created the position of Fair Employment Officer. The order \"established in the Civil Service Commission a Fair Employment Board of not less than seven persons.\"[36] Executive Order 9981, named Establishing the President\\'s Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services, called for the integration of the Armed Forces and the creation of the National Military Establishment to carry out the executive order.[38]\\n On December 3, 1951, Truman issued Executive Order 10308, named Improving the Means for Obtaining Compliance with the Nondiscrimination Provisions of Federal Contracts,[39] which established an anti-discrimination committee on government contract compliance responsible for ensuring that employers doing business with the federal government comply with all laws and regulations enacted by Congress and the committee on the grounds of discriminatory practices.[39]\\n \\n Eisenhower (1953–1961) \\n [edit] When Eisenhower was elected president in 1952 after defeating Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson, he believed hiring practices and anti-discrimination laws should be decided by the states, although the administration gradually continued to desegregate the Armed Forces and the federal'),\n",

Kennedy \"criticized President Eisenhower for not ending discrimination in federally supported housing\" and \"advocated a permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission\".[18]:\\u200a59\\u200a Shortly after taking office, Kennedy issued Executive Order 10925 in March 1961, requiring government contractors to \"consider and recommend additional affirmative steps which should be taken by executive departments and agencies to realize more fully the national policy of nondiscrimination.... The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin\".[18]:\\u200a60\\u200a The order also established the President\\'s Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity (PCEEO), chaired by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. Federal contractors who failed to comply or violated the executive order were punished by contract cancellation and the possible debarment from future government contracts. The administration was \"not demanding any special preference or treatment or quotas for minorities\" but was rather \"advocating racially neutral hiring to end job discrimination\".[18]:\\u200a61\\u200a Turning to issues of women\\'s rights, Kennedy initiated a Commission on the Status of Women in December 1961. The commission was charged with \"examining employment policies and practices of the government and of contractors\" with regard to sex.[18]:\\u200a66\\u200a\\n In June 1963, President Kennedy continued his policy of affirmative action by issuing another mandate, Executive Order 11114. The order supplemented to his previous 1961 executive order declaring it was the \"policy of the United States to encourage by affirmative action the elimination of discrimination in employment\".[18]:\\u200a72\\u200a Through this order, all federal funds, such as \"grants, loans, unions and employers who accepted taxpayer funds, and other forms of financial assistance to state and local governments,\" were forced to comply to the government\\'s policies on affirmative'),\n",

Johnson, the Texas Democrat and Senate Majority Leader from 1955 to 1961, began to consider running for high office, and in doing so showed how his racial views differed from those held by many White Americans in the traditional South. In 1957, Johnson brokered a civil rights act through Congress. The bill established a Civil Rights Division and Commission in the Justice Department. The commission was empowered to investigate allegations of minority deprivation of rights.[18]:\\u200a57\\u200a\\n The first time \"affirmative action\" is used by the federal government concerning race is in President John F. Kennedy\\'s Executive Order 10925, which was chaired by Vice President Johnson. At Johnson\\'s inaugural ball in Texas, he met with a young black lawyer, Hobart Taylor, Jr., and gave him the task to co-author the executive order. \"Affirmative action\" was chosen due to its alliterative quality. The term \"active recruitment\" started to be used as well. This order, albeit heavily worked up as a significant piece of legislation, in reality carried little actual power. The scope was limited to a couple hundred defense contractors, leaving nearly $7.5 billion in federal grants and loans unsupervised.[18]:\\u200a60\\u200a\\n The NAACP had many problems with JFK\\'s \"token\" proposal. They wanted jobs. One day after the order took effect, NAACP labor secretary Herbert Hill filed complaints against the hiring and promoting practices of Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. Lockheed was doing business with the Defense Department on the first billion-dollar contract. Due to taxpayer-funding being 90% of Lockheed\\'s business, along with disproportionate hiring practices, black workers charged Lockheed with \"overt discrimination.\" Lockheed signed an agreement with Vice President Johnson that pledged an \"aggressive seeking out for more qualified minority candidates for technical and skill positions.[18]:\\u200a63–64\\u200a\\nThis agreement was the administration\\'s model for a \"plan of progress.\" Johnson and his assistants soon pressured other defense contractors, including Boeing and General Electric, to sign similar voluntary agreements indicating plans for progress. However, these plans were just that, voluntary. Many corporations in the South, still afflicted with Jim Crow laws, largely ignored the federal recommendations.[18]:\\u200a63–64\\u200a\\n This eventually led to LBJ\\'s Civil Rights Act'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content='18]:\\u200a63–64\\u200a\\n This eventually led to LBJ\\'s Civil Rights Act, which came shortly after President Kennedy\\'s assassination. This document was more holistic than any President Kennedy had offered, and therefore more controversial. It aimed not only to integrate public facilities, but also private businesses that sold to the public, such as motels, restaurants, theaters, and gas stations. Public schools, hospitals, libraries, parks, among other things, were included in the bill as well. It also worked with JFK\\'s executive order 11114 by prohibiting discrimination in the awarding of federal contracts and holding the authority of the government to deny contracts to businesses who discriminate. Maybe most significant of all, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act aimed to end discrimination in all firms with 25 or more employees. Another provision established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as the agency charged with ending discrimination in the nation\\'s workplace.[18]:\\u200a74\\u200a\\n Conservatives said that Title VII of the bill advocated a de facto quota system, and asserted unconstitutionality as it attempts to regulate the workplace. Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey corrected this notion: \"there is nothing in [Title VII] that will give power to the Commission to require hiring, firing, and promotion to meet a racial \\'quota.\\' [. . .] Title VII is designed to encourage the hiring on basis of ability and qualifications, not race or religion.\" Title VII prohibits discrimination. Humphrey was the silent hero of the bill\\'s passing through Congress. He pledged that the bill required no quotas, just nondiscrimination. Doing so, he convinced many pro-business Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen (IL) to support Title VII.[18]:\\u200a78–80\\u200a\\n On July 2, 1964, the Act was signed into law by President Johnson. A Harris poll that spring showed 70% citizen approval of the Act.[18]:\\u200a82\\u200a\\n \\n Nixon (1969–1974) \\n [edit] The strides that the Johnson presidency made in ensuring equal opportunity in the workforce were built upon by his successor Richard Nixon. In 1969, the Nixon administration initiated the \"Philadelphia Order\". It was regarded as the most forceful plan thus far to guarantee fair hiring practices in construction jobs. Philadelphia was selected as the test case because, as Assistant Secretary of Labor Arthur Fletcher explained, \"The craft unions and the construction industry are among the most egregious offenders against equal opportunity laws . . . openly hostile toward letting blacks into their closed circle.\" The order included'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=' against equal opportunity laws . . . openly hostile toward letting blacks into their closed circle.\" The order included definite \"goals and timetables.\" As President Nixon asserted, \"We would not impose quotas, but would require federal contractors to show \\'affirmative action\\' to meet the goals of increasing minority employment.\"[40]\\nIt was through the Philadelphia Plan that the Nixon administration formed their adapted definition of affirmative action and became the official policy of the US government. The plan was defined as \"racial goals and timetables, not quotas\".[18]:\\u200a124\\u200a  \\nCongressional \"guidelines\" were promulgated for government agencies, and government contractors, to reach 30+\\xa0% minority employees within three years; and greater than 40% within five years.  It became the \"era of the \\'three-banger\\'\" (the darker-complected, \\'MS\\', latin surname); wherein with one individual hire, the agency received three AA credits.  <Per employment interview with a Gen. Elec. recruiter; Philadelphia, PA; autumn 1974, Taylor>\\n \\n Ford (1974–1977) \\n [edit] After the Nixon administration, advancements in affirmative action became less prevalent. \"During the brief Ford administration, affirmative action took a back seat, while enforcement stumbled along.\"[18]:\\u200a145\\u200a Equal rights was still an important subject to many Americans, yet the world was changing and new issues were being raised. People began to look at affirmative action as a glorified issue of the past and now there were other areas that needed focus. \"Of all the triumphs that have marked this as America\\'s Century –...none is more inspiring, if incomplete, than our pursuit of racial justice.\"[41]\\n In the first half of the 20th century segregation was considered fair and normal. Due to changes made in American society and governmental policies the United States is past the traditional assumptions of race relations.[18]:\\u200a275\\u200a\\n \"Affirmative action is a national policy that concerns the way Americans feel about race, past discrimination, preferences, merit – and about themselves. This is why it is an American dilemma, and that is why we must understand how it developed and how its rationale and definition have changed since the 1960s.\"[18]:\\u200a283\\u200a\\n \\n Reagan (1981–1989) \\n [edit] In 1983, Reagan signed Executive Order 12432, which instructed government agencies to create a development plan for Minority Business Enterprises.

While the Reagan administration opposed discriminatory practices, it did not support the implementation of quotas and goals (Executive Order 11246).[42] Bi-partisan opposition in Congress and other government officials blocked the repeal of this Executive Order [clarification needed]. Reagan was particularly known for his opposition to affirmative action programs. He reduced funding for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, arguing that \"reverse discrimination\" resulted from these policies.[43] However, the courts reaffirmed affirmative action policies such as quotas. In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled that courts could order race-based quotas to fight discrimination in worker unions in Sheet Metal Workers\\' International Association v. EEOC, 478 U.S. 42. In 1987, in Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, California, 480 U.S. 616, the Supreme Court ruled that sex or race was a factor that could be considered in a pool of qualified candidates by employers.[44]\\n \\n Obama (2009–2017) \\n [edit] After the election and inauguration of Barack Obama in the 2008 election, a huge excitement swept the nation for the first African-American president of the United States. Many supporters and citizens began to hope for a future with affirmative action that would be secure under a black president. However, progress was not as apparent within the first few years of president Obama\\'s administration. In 2009, education statistics denote the problems of college admissions in the US: \"The College Board recently released the average 2009 SAT scores by race and ethnicity. They found that the gap between Black and Latino student versus White and Asian students has widened, despite the College Board\\'s recent efforts to change questions to eliminate cultural biases.\"[45] To the administration, it was apparent that more work was needed to better the situation. The following year in 2010, Obama presented his plan regarding the past administration\\'s policy, under George W. Bush, called the \"No Child Left Behind Act.\" Unlike the No Child Left Behind Act, president Obama\\'s policy would instead reward schools and institutions for working with minorities and oppressed students. Additionally, in an indirect manner, the Obama administration aimed to garner support for more federal money and funds to be allocated to financial aid and scholarships to universities and colleges within the United States.[45] They also have endorsed the decision of Fisher vs. University of Texas where the Supreme Court decision which endorses \"the use of affirmative action to achieve a diverse student body so long as programs are narrowly tailored to advance this goal'),\n",

The guidelines the administration set were aimed to curb the Supreme Court decision\\'s in Fisher v. University of Texas.[46][48][49]\\n In 2019, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled in Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, a lawsuit alleging discrimination in admission against Asian Americans by the college, that Harvard\\'s system, while imperfect, nonetheless passed constitutional muster.[50][51]\\n \\n Biden (2021–) \\n [edit] The case was appealed, and in January 2022, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case together with a similar case related to admissions practices at the University of North Carolina.[52][53] The case was argued on October 31, 2022.[54] After the court rejected affirmative action at U.S. colleges and universities on June 29, 2023, President Joe Biden said he \"strongly\" disagreed with the decision. In a televised address, he urged the nation to make sure the decision did not become \"the last word\" on affirmative action. \"Discrimination still exists in America,\" he said.[55]\\n \\n Legal history \\n [edit] \\n Executive actions and legislation \\n [edit] 1961 – Executive Order 10925,[56] issued by President Kennedy 1964 – Section 717 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees and job applicants from employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin but does not authorize group preferences.

It was defeated in the November election in 2019 by a direct majority vote, effectively continuing the ban on Affirmative Action put in place by Initiative 200 in 1998. \\n Arguments in favor of affirmative action \\n [edit] President Kennedy stated in Executive Order 10925 that \"discrimination because of race, creed, color, or national origin is contrary to the Constitutional principles and policies of the United States\"; that \"it is the plain and positive obligation of the United States Government to promote and ensure equal opportunity for all qualified persons, without regard to race, creed, color, or national origin, employed or seeking employment with the Federal Government and on government contracts\"; that \"it is the policy of the executive branch of the Government to encourage by positive measures equal opportunity for all qualified persons within the Government\"; and that \"it is in the general interest and welfare of the United States to promote its economy, security, and national defense through the most efficient and effective utilization of all available manpower\".[56]\\n Some individual American states also have orders that prohibit discrimination and outline affirmative action requirements with regard to race, creed, color, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, gender, age, and disability status.[93]\\n Proponents of affirmative action argue that by nature the system is not only race based, but also class and gender based. To eliminate two of its key components would undermine the purpose of the entire system. The African American Policy Forum believes that the class based argument is based on the idea that non-poor minorities do not experience racial and gender based discrimination. The AAPF believes that \"Race-conscious affirmative action remains necessary to address race-based obstacles that block the path to success of countless people of color of all classes\". The group goes on to say that affirmative action is responsible for creating the African American middle class, so it does not make sense to say that the system only benefits the middle and upper classes.[94]\\n Researchers told ABC News in 2023 that economic inequality, segregation and academic inequity in K-12 schools, as well as the lasting effect of past exclusion from colleges and universities have led to the continued underrepresentation of Black and brown students in four-year institutions.[95]\\n \\n Example of success in women \\n [edit] Supporters of affirmative action point out the benefits women gained from the policy as evidence of its ability to assist historically marginalized groups.

In the fifty years that disenfranchised groups have been the subject of affirmative action laws, their representation has risen dramatically[96] in the workforce, but some research suggests the increase in white women is due to their decision to enter their workforce rather than affirmative action.[97]\\n According to anti-racism activist Tim Wise:\\n Thanks in large measure to affirmative action and civil rights protections that opened up previously restricted opportunities to women of all colors, from 1972 to 1993:\\n – The percentage of women architects increased from 3% to nearly 19% of the total;\\n – The percentage of women doctors more than doubled from 10% to 22% of all doctors;\\n – The percentage of women lawyers grew from 4% to 23% of the national total;\\n – The percentage of female engineers went from less than 1% to nearly 9%;\\n – The percentage of female chemists grew from 10% to 30% of all chemists; and,\\n – The percentage of female college faculty went from 28% to 42% of all faculty. (Moseley-Braun 1995, 8)\\n \\nFurthermore, since only 1983, the percentage of women business managers and professionals grew from 41% of all such persons, to 48%, while the number of female police officers more than doubled, from 6% to 13% (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1995, Table 649). According to a 1995 study, there are at least six million women — the overwhelming majority of them white — who simply wouldn't have the jobs they have today, but for the inroads made by affirmative action (Cose 1997, 171).[98] \\n Need to counterbalance historic inequalities \\n [edit] \\n African Americans \\n [edit] For the first 250 years of America's recorded history, Africans were traded as commodities and forced to work without pay, first as indentured servants then as slaves. In much of the United States at this time, they were barred from all levels of education, from basic reading to higher-level skills useful outside of the plantation setting.[99]\\n After slavery's abolition in 1865, Black-Americans saw the educational gap between themselves and whites compounded by segregation. They were forced to attend separate, under-funded schools due to Plessy v. Ferguson. Though de jure school segregation ended with Brown v. Board of Education, de facto segregation continues in education into the present day.[100]\\n Following the end of World\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=', de facto segregation continues in education into the present day.[100]\\n Following the end of World War II, the educational gap between White and Black Americans was widened by Franklin D. Roosevelt\\'s GI Bill. This piece of legislation paved the way for white GIs to attend college. Despite their veteran status, returning Black servicemen were not afforded loans at the same rate as White ones. Furthermore, at the time of its introduction, segregation was still the law of the land barring blacks from the best institutions. Overall, \"Nearly 8 million servicemen and servicewomen were educated under the provisions of the GI Bill after World War II. But for blacks, higher educational opportunities were so few that the promise of the GI Bill went largely unfulfilled.\"[101]\\n \\n Hispanic Americans \\n [edit] According to a study by Dr. Paul Brest, Hispanics or \"Latinos\" include immigrants who are descendants of immigrants from the countries comprising Central and South America.[102] In 1991, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans made up 80% of the Latino population in the United States. Latinos are disadvantaged compared to White Americans and are more likely to live in poverty.[102] They are the least well-educated major ethnic group and suffered a 3% drop in high school completion rate while African Americans experienced a 12% increase between 1975 and 1990.[102] In 1990, they constituted 9% of the population, but only received 3.1% of the bachelors\\'s degrees awarded. At times when it was favorable to lawmakers, Latinos were considered \"white\" under Jim Crow laws during Reconstruction.[102] In other cases, according to Paul Brest, Latinos have been classified as an inferior race and a threat to white purity. Latinos have encountered considerable discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, and education.[102] Brest finds that stereotypes continue to be largely negative and many perceive Latinos as \"lazy, unproductive, and on the dole.\"[102] Furthermore, native-born Latino-Americans and recent immigrants are seen as identical since outsiders tend not to differentiate between Latino groups.[102]\\n \\n Native Americans \\n [edit] The category of Native American applies to the diverse group of people who lived in North America before European settlement.[102] During the U.S. government\\'s westward expansion, Native Americans were displaced from their land which had been their home for centuries. Instead, they were forced onto reservations which were far smaller and less productive.[102] According to Brest, land'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=' were forced onto reservations which were far smaller and less productive.[102] According to Brest, land belonging to Native Americans was reduced from 138 million acres in 1887 to 52 million acres in 1934.[102] In 1990, the poverty rate for Native Americans was more than triple that of the whites and only 9.4% of Native Americans have completed a bachelor\\'s degree as opposed to 25.2% of whites and 12.2% of African Americans.[102]\\n \\n Asian Americans \\n [edit] Early Asian immigrants experienced prejudice and discrimination in the forms of not having the ability to become naturalized citizens. They also struggled with many of the same school segregation laws that African Americans faced.[102] Particularly, during World War II, Japanese Americans were interned in camps and lost their property, homes, and businesses.[102] Discrimination against Asians began with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and then continued with the Scott Act of 1888 and the Geary Act of 1892. At the beginning of the 20th century, the United States passed the Immigration Act of 1924 to prevent Asian immigration out of fear that Asians were stealing white jobs and lowering the standard for wages.[102] In addition, whites and non-Asians do not differentiate among the different Asian groups and perpetuate the \"model minority\" stereotype. According to a 2010 article by Professor Qin Zhang of Fairfield University, Asians are characterized as one dimensional in having great work ethic and valuing education, but lacking in communication skills and personality.[102][103] A negative outcome of this incorrect stereotype is that Asians have been portrayed as having poor leadership and interpersonal skills. This has contributed to the \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon in which although there are many qualified Asian Americans, they occupy a disproportionately small number of executive positions in businesses;[102] although this has recently changed with the many successes of Asian billionaires,[104] pop-culture icons including Bruce Lee, sports figures such as Jeremy Lin, gold-medal figure skater Michelle Kwan, and free-style skier Eileen Gu.\\n \\n Fair vs. equal/discrimination vs. inclusion \\n [edit] Many proponents of affirmative action recognize that the policy is inherently unequal; however, minding the inescapable fact that historic inequalities exist in America, they believe the policy is much more fair than one in which these circumstances are not taken into account. Furthermore, those in favor of affirmative action see it as an effort towards inclusion rather than a discriminatory practice. \"Job discrimination is grounded in prejudice and exclusion,'),\n",

The most effective way to cure society of exclusionary practices is to make special efforts at inclusion, which is exactly what affirmative action does.\"[105]\\n \\n Diversity \\n [edit] Diversity, equity, and inclusion The National Conference of State Legislatures stated in a 2014 overview that many supporters for affirmative action argue that policies stemming from affirmative action help to open doors for historically excluded groups in workplace settings and higher education.[1] Workplace diversity has become a business management concept in which employers actively seek to promote an inclusive workplace.[106] By valuing diversity, employers possess the capacity to create an environment in which there is a culture of respect for individual differences as well as the ability to draw in talent and ideas from all segments of the population.[107] By creating this diverse workforce, these employers and companies gain a competitive advantage in an increasingly global economy.[107] According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, many private sector employers have concluded that a diverse workforce makes a \"company stronger, more profitable, and a better place to work.\" Therefore, these diversity promoting policies are implemented for competitive reasons rather than as a response to discrimination, but have shown the value in having diversity.[106]\\n The American Association of University Professors (AAUP),  in 2000 concluded that the consensus of research found that \"the resulting diversity actually helps the institution achieve its educational goals....racial and ethnic diversity has both direct and indirect positive effects on the educational outcomes and experiences of college students\" [108] [109] According to a study by Geoffrey Maruyama and José F. Moreno, the results showed that faculty members believed diversity helps students to reach the essential goals of a college education, Caucasian students suffer no detrimental effects from classroom diversity, and that attention to multicultural learning improves the ability of colleges and universities to accomplish their missions.[109] Furthermore, a diverse population of students offers unique perspectives in order to challenge preconceived notions through exposure to the experiences and ideas of others.[110] According to Professor Gurin of the University of Michigan, skills such as \"perspective-taking, acceptance of differences, a willingness and capacity to find commonalities among differences, acceptance of conflict as normal, conflict resolution, participation in democracy, and interest in the wider social world\" can potentially be developed in college while being exposed to heterogeneous group of students.[109] In addition, broad'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content=' be developed in college while being exposed to heterogeneous group of students.[109] In addition, broadening perspectives helps students confront personal and substantive stereotypes and fosters discussion about racial and ethnic issues in a classroom setting.[110] Furthermore, the 2000 AAUP study states that having a diversity of views leads to a better discussion and greater understanding among the students on issues of race, tolerance, fairness, etc.[109]\\n Fidan Ana Kurtulus, an economics professor, found that during the 1970s and early 1980s, affirmative action led to an increase in the share of women and minorities working in federal contractors compared to firms that were not required to follow affirmative action guidelines.[111][112]\\n \\n Prominent people in support of affirmative action \\n [edit] There have been many supporters of affirmative action over the course of American history. Several prominent figures in the civil rights movement, including Martin Luther King Jr., Bayard Rustin, and Thurgood Marshall, have expressed support for affirmative action in some respect.[113] In Why We Can\\'t Wait, King advocated for racial preference to be given to  African Americans to counteract the oppression they\\'d endured for centuries.\\n No amount of gold could provide an adequate compensation for the exploitation and humiliation of the Negro in America down through the centuries. Not all the wealth of this affluent society could meet the bill. Yet a price can be placed on unpaid wages. The ancient common law has always provided a remedy for the appropriation of the labor of one human being by another. This law should be made to apply for American Negroes. The payment should be in the form of a massive program by the government of special, compensatory measures which could be regarded as a settlement in accordance with the accepted practice of common law.  These \"compensatory measures\" included a system resembling reparations for slavery, as well as preferential treatment in college admissions decisions.[114] Rustin was in favor of similar policies, although in his lifetime, he was more critical of universities admitting based on applicants\\' races.[115] Marshall, on the other hand, was a firm believer in affirmative action in admissions decisions, writing, following the verdict on Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, \"it is because of a legacy of unequal treatment that we now must permit the institutions of this society to give consideration to race in making decisions about who will hold the positions of influence, affluence, and prestige in America.”[113]\\n Many presidents throughout the last century have failed to take a'),\n",

Bill Clinton, however, made his stance on affirmative action very clear in a speech on July 19, 1995, nearly two and a half years after his inauguration. In his speech, he discussed the history in the United States that brought the policy into fruition: slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation. Clinton also mentioned a point similar to President Lyndon B. Johnson\\'s \"Freedom is not Enough\" speech, and declared that just outlawing discrimination in the country would not be enough to give everyone in America equality. He addressed the arguments that affirmative action hurt the white middle class and said that the policy was not the source of their problems. Clinton plainly outlined his stance on affirmative action, saying:\\n Let me be clear about what affirmative action must not mean and what I won\\'t allow it to be. It does not mean – and I don\\'t favor – the unjustified preference of the unqualified over the qualified of any race or gender. It doesn\\'t mean – and I don\\'t favor – numerical quotas. It doesn\\'t mean – and I don\\'t favor – rejection or selection of any employee or student solely on the basis of race or gender without regard to merit... In the end, Clinton stated that all the evidence shows that, even though affirmative action should be a temporary policy, the time had not come for it to be ended. He felt it was still a relevant practice and overall, the goal of the nation should be \"mend it, but don\\'t end it.\"  Clinton\\'s words became a slogan for many Americans on the topic of affirmative action.[18]\\n In addition to activists and politicians, several modern-day academics and political theorists support affirmative action, including Ibram X. Kendi and Robin DiAngelo.[113]\\n \\n Arguments against affirmative action \\n [edit] Affirmative action has been the subject of numerous court cases, where it is often contested on constitutional grounds. Some states specifically prohibit affirmative action, such as California (Proposition 209), Washington (Initiative 200), Michigan (Michigan Civil Rights Initiative), and Nebraska (Nebraska Civil Rights Initiative).\\n \\n Bias \\n [edit] [116] A 2005 study by Princeton sociologists Thomas J.

Chung compared the effects of affirmative action on racial and special groups at three highly selective private research universities. The data from the study represent admissions disadvantage and advantage in terms of SAT points (on the old 1600-point scale):\\n Whites (non-recruited athlete/non-legacy status): 0 (control group) Blacks: +230 Hispanics: +185 Asians: –50 Recruited athletes: +200 Legacies (children of alumni): +160[117] In 2009, Princeton sociologist Thomas Espenshade and researcher Alexandria Walton Radford, in their book No Longer Separate, Not Yet Equal, examined data on students applying to college in 1997 and calculated that Asian-Americans needed nearly perfect SAT scores of 1550 to have the same chance of being accepted at a top private university as whites who scored 1410 and African Americans who got 1100.[118]\\n citation needed [119] After controlling for grades, test scores, family background (legacy status), and athletic status (whether or not the student was a recruited athlete), Espenshade and Radford found that whites were three times, Hispanics six times, and blacks more than 15 times as likely to be accepted at a US university as Asian Americans.[120] Thomas Espenshade cautions though, \"I stop short of saying that Asian-American students are being discriminated against in the college application process because we don\\'t have sufficient empirical evidence to support that claim.\"[121]\\n \\n Mismatch effect \\n [edit] According to Richard Sander, artificially elevating minority students into schools they otherwise would not be capable of attending discourages them and tends to engender failure and high dropout rates for these students. For example, about half of Black college students rank in the bottom 20 percent of their classes,[122] Black law school graduates are four times as likely to fail bar exams as are whites, and interracial friendships are more likely to form among students with relatively similar levels of academic preparation; thus, Black and Hispanic people are more socially integrated on campuses where they are less academically mismatched.[123] He states that the supposed \"beneficiaries\" of affirmative action – minorities – do not actually benefit and rather are harmed by the policy.[124] Sander\\'s ideas have been disputed, and his empirical analyses have been subject to substantial criticism.[125] A group including some of the country\\'s lead statistical methodologists told the Supreme Court that Sander\\'s analyses were sufficiently flawed that the Court would be wise to ignore them'),\n",

Yoon confirmed Sander\\'s mismatch findings, but also found that eliminating affirmative action would \"lead to a 63 percent decline in Black matriculants at all law schools and a 90 percent decline at elite law schools.\"[127] These high numbers predictions were doubted in a review of previous studies by Peter Arcidiacono and Michael Lovenheim. Their 2016 article found a strong indication that racial preference results in a mismatch effect. However, they argued that the attendance by some African-American law students to less-selective schools would significantly improve the low first attempt rate at passing the state bar, but they cautioned that such improvements could be outweighed by decreases in law school attendance.[128] \\n A 2021 study in the Quarterly Journal of Economics found that the 1998 ban on race-based affirmative action in California public universities led to lower wages for minority applicants and deterred qualified students from applying, which it stated was inconsistent with the mismatch effect.[129] A 2023 study published in Research in Higher Education also argues against mismatch and explains that Ariciacono and Lovenheim\\'s findings are not supported when considering additional states and years. [130]\\n \\n Class inequality \\n [edit] The controversy surrounding affirmative action\\'s effectiveness is based on the idea of class inequality. Opponents of racial affirmative action argue that the program actually benefits middle- and upper-class African Americans and Hispanic Americans at the expense of lower-class European Americans and Asian Americans. This argument supports the idea of class-based affirmative action. America\\'s poor population is disproportionately made up of people of color, so class-based affirmative action would disproportionately help people of color. This would eliminate the need for race-based affirmative action as well as reducing any disproportionate benefits for middle- and upper-class people of color.[131]\\n In 1976, a group of Italian American professors at City University of New York successfully advocated to be added as an affirmative action category for promotion and hiring. Italian Americans are usually considered white in the US and would not be covered under affirmative action policies, but statistical evidence suggested that Italian Americans were underrepresented relative to the proportion of Italian American residents in New York City.[132][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed]\\n Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell wrote in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study, that affirmative action policies encourage non-'),\n",

He believes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids consideration of race, such as in race-based affirmative action or preferential treatment. He also believes it creates \"a cult of victimization\" and implies blacks require \"special treatment in order to succeed.\" Thomas also cites his own experiences of affirmative action programs as a reason for his criticism.[135][136]\\n Frederick Lynch, the author of Invisible Victims: White Males and the Crisis of Affirmative Action, did a study on white males that said they were victims of reverse discrimination.[137] Lynch explains that these white men felt frustrated and unfairly victimized by affirmative action.[138] Shelby Steele, another author against affirmative action, wanted to see affirmative action go back to its original meaning of enforcing equal opportunity. He argued that blacks had to take full responsibility in their education and in maintaining a job. Steele believes that there is still a long way to go in America to reach the goal of eradicating discrimination.[138]\\n Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study.[133] Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole'),\n",

Race, ethnicity, native language, social class, geographical origin, parental attendance of the university in question (legacy admissions), and/or gender are sometimes taken into account when the university assesses an applicant\\'s grades and test scores. Individuals can also be awarded scholarships and have fees paid on the basis of criteria listed above.[citation needed] Sex-based affirmative action is legal under Title IX, which exempts sex-based discrimination in admissions to private undergraduate colleges.[139]\\n In the early 1970s, Walter J. Leonard, an administrator at Harvard University, invented the Harvard Plan, \"one of the country\\'s earliest and most effective affirmative-action programs, which became a model for other universities around the country.\"[140] In 1978, the Supreme Court ruled in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke that public universities (and other government institutions) could not set specific numerical targets based on race for admissions or employment; the Court said that \"goals\" and \"timetables\" for diversity could be set instead.[141][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed]\\n Dean of Yale Law School Louis Pollak wrote in 1969 that for the previous 15 years Yale \"customarily gave less weight to the LSAT and the rest of the standard academic apparatus in assessing black applicants\". He wrote that while most black students had \"not achieved academic distinction\", \"very few have failed to graduate\" and that \"many black alumni have ... speedily demonstrated professional accomplishments of a high order\". Pollak justified the university\\'s plans to increase the number of minority students admitted with lowered standards \"in the fact ... that the country needs far more—and especially far more well-trained—black lawyers, bearing in mind that today only 2 or 3 per cent of the American bar is black\", and that if Yale could help \"in meeting this important national need, it ought to try to do so\". He believed that the \"minor fraction of the student body\"—up to two dozen in the class entering that year—with \"prior educational deficiencies\" was not likely to damage the school, and expected that the number of \"well prepared\" black'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents/https:__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States.txt'}, page_content='\" was not likely to damage the school, and expected that the number of \"well prepared\" black applicants would greatly increase in the future.[142]\\n Scholars such as Ronald Dworkin have asserted that no college applicant has a right to expect that a university will design its admissions policies in a way that prizes any particular set of qualities.[143] In this view, admission is not an honor bestowed to reward superior merit but rather a way to advance the mission as each university defines it. If diversity is a goal of the university and their racial preferences do not discriminate against applicants based on hatred or contempt, then affirmative action can be judged acceptable based on the criteria related to the mission the university sets for itself.[144]\\n Consistent with this view, admissions officers often claim to select students not based on academic record alone but also on commitment, enthusiasm, motivation, and potential.[145] Highly selective institutions of higher learning do not simply select only the highest SAT performers to populate their undergraduate courses, but high performers, with scores of 2250 to 2400 points, are extraordinarily well-represented at these institutions.[146]\\n To accommodate the ruling in Hopwood v. Texas banning any use of race in school admissions, the State of Texas passed a law guaranteeing entry to any state university if a student finished in the top 10% of their graduating class. Florida and California also have similar college admission guarantees. Class rank tends to benefit top students at less competitive high schools, to the detriment of students at more competitive high schools. This effect, however, may be intentional since less-funded, less competitive schools are more likely to be schools where minority enrollment is high. Critics argue that class rank is more a measure of one\\'s peers than of one\\'s self. The top 10% rule adds racial diversity only because schools are still highly racially segregated because of residential patterns.[147] To some extent, the class rank rule has the same effect as traditional affirmative action.[147] From 1996 to 1998, Texas did not practice affirmative action in public college admissions, and minority enrollment dropped. The state\\'s adoption of the \"top 10 percent\" rule has helped return minority enrollment to pre-1996 levels.[147] Race-conscious admissions continue to be practiced in Texas following Fisher v. University of Texas.\\n \\n Effectiveness \\n [edit] Professor Cornel West estimated that when he attended Harvard College in the early-1970\\'s, 95% of black students were descended from American black families dating back to the Jim Crow era.[148] But during a panel discussion at Harvard'),\n",

Guinier and Gates claimed that only about a third of black Harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the African American community, and that the majority of black students at Harvard were Caribbean and African immigrants or their children, and/or mixed-race children of biracial couples.[149] By 2007, 41% of black students at Ivy League colleges were reportedly first- or second-generation immigrants, a group which made up only 13% of the US black population. In 2020, Harvard students whose families had been in the US for generations began referring to themselves as \"Generational African-Americans\", who hypothesized that their numbers were vanishingly small.[148] The subject is alleged to be \"taboo\" among admissions officers, and black Harvard students have claimed the university has discouraged them from collecting demographic information about the backgrounds of the black student population.[149]\\n UCLA professor Richard H. Sander published an article in the November 2004 issue of the Stanford Law Review that questioned the effectiveness of racial preferences in law schools. He noted that, prior to his article, there had been no comprehensive study on the effects of affirmative action.[124] The article presents a study that shows that half of all black law students rank near the bottom of their class after the first year of law school and that black law students are more likely to drop out of law school and to fail the bar exam.[124] The article offers a tentative estimate that the production of new black lawyers in the United States would grow by eight percent if affirmative action programs at all law schools were ended. Less qualified black students would attend less prestigious schools where they would be more closely matched in abilities with their classmates and thus perform relatively better.[124] Sander helped to develop a socioeconomically based affirmative action plan for the UCLA School of Law after the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996, which prohibited the use of racial preferences by public universities in California. This change occurred after studies showed that the graduation rate of blacks at UCLA was 41%, compared to 73% for whites.\\n A 2007 study by Mark Long, an economics professor at the University'),\n",

Specifically, apparent rebounds of black and Hispanic enrollment were, in fact, explained by increasing minority enrollment in high schools of those states, and the primary beneficiaries of these \"class-based\" affirmative action policies appeared to be white students. On the other hand, Long noted that affirmative action itself has both moral and material costs, including the unpopularity of race-based affirmative action in college admissions; the high costs associated with full-file reviews of applicants; and the specter of litigation.[150]\\n A 2020 study by UC Berkeley Center Studies in Higher Education researcher Zachary Bleemer on the impact of California\\'s ban on affirmative action on student outcomes using a difference-in-difference research design and a newly constructed longitudinal database linking all 1994–2002 University of California applicants to their college enrollment, course performance, major choice, degree attainment, and wages into their mid-30s found \"the first causal evidence that banning affirmative action exacerbates socioeconomic inequities.\"[151] According to the study, the ban on affirmative action decreased Black and Latino student enrollment within the University of California system, reduced their likelihood of graduating and attending graduate school, and resulted in a decline in wages. At the same time, the policy did not significantly impact white and Asian American students.\\n A 2023 study by Harvard University Fellow in Ethnoracial Relations David Mickey-Pabello provides evidence that more schools were impacted by state-level bans on affirmative action than previously known. Mickey-Pabello describes a process termed the \"anti-affirmative action avalanche\" where underrepresented minority students are displaced from the most highly selective schools, and some ultimately enroll at for-profit schools.[152] The for-profit schools that had high enrollments of underrepresented minority students after state-level affirmative action bans in this study were also subsequently involved in lawsuits for predatory and illegal recruitment practices.

Fleming criticized the Yale system as \"a long step toward the practice of apartheid and the maintenance of two law schools under one roof\", with consequent \"damage to the standards of Yale Law School\". He warned that such an admission policy \"will serve to perpetuate the very ideas and prejudices it is designed to combat. If in a given class the great majority of the black students are at the bottom of the class\", it would result in racial stratification between students, demands by black students to weaken academic standards, and other racially based \"aggressive conduct\". Fleming noted that racial quotas were a zero-sum game, as \"discrimination in favor of X is automatic discrimination against Y\"; Asians in California, for example, were overrepresented in engineering schools and would suffer if black and Mexican applicants received preferential treatment. He stated that a quota system violated \"the American creed, one that Yale has proudly espoused ... that an American should be judged as an individual and not as a member of a group\".[142]\\n In 2006, Jian Li, a Chinese undergraduate at Yale University, filed a civil rights complaint with the Office for Civil Rights against Princeton University, claiming that his race played a role in their decision to reject his application for admission and seeking the suspension of federal financial assistance to the university until it \"discontinues discrimination against Asian Americans in all forms\" by eliminating race and legacy preferences. Princeton Dean of Admissions Janet Rapelye responded to the claims in the November 30, 2006, issue of the Daily Princetonian by stating that \"the numbers don\\'t indicate [discrimination].\" She said that Li was not admitted because \"many others had far better qualifications.\" Li\\'s extracurricular activities were described as \"not all that outstanding\".[155] Li countered in an email, saying that his placement on the waitlist undermines Rapelye\\'s claim. \"Princeton had initially waitlisted my application,\" Li said. \"So if it were not for a yield which was higher than expected, the admissions office very well may have admitted a candidate whose \"outside activities were not all that outstanding\".[156] In September 2015, the Department of Justice concluded its nine-year investigation into alleged anti-Asian bias at Princeton and cleared Princeton of charges that it discriminated against Asian American applicants.[157] Furthermore, the department found that a number of Asian American students benefitted from race-conscious admissions.['),\n",

In July 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that UT maintained a \"holistic\" approach in its application of affirmative action, and could continue the practice. On February 10, 2015, lawyers for Fisher filed a new case in the Supreme Court. It is a renewed complaint that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit got the issue wrong—on the second try as well as on the first.[162]  The Supreme Court agreed in June 2015 to hear the case a second time. In July 2016 a majority of the Court found in favor of the University of Texas at Austin, with Justice Kennedy finding for the Court that the university\\'s affirmative action policies were constitutional, despite the requirement of strict scrutiny.\\n \\n Students for Fair Admissions \\n [edit] Students for Fair Admissions v.

University of Texas at Austin for the second time.[163]\\n In May 2015, a coalition of more than 60 Asian-American organizations filed federal complaints with the Education and Justice Departments against Harvard University. The coalition asked for a civil rights investigation into what they described as  Harvard\\'s discriminatory admission practices against Asian-American applicants.[164][165][166] The complaint asserts that recent studies indicate that Harvard has engaged in systematic and continuous discrimination against Asian Americans in its \"holistic\" admissions process. Asian-American applicants with near-perfect test scores, top-one-percent grade point averages, academic awards, and leadership positions are allegedly rejected by Harvard because the university uses racial stereotypes, racially differentiated standards, and de facto racial quotas.[167] Harvard denies engaging in discrimination and said its admissions philosophy complies with the law. The school said the percentage of Asian-American students admitted has grown from 17% to 21% in a decade while Asian-Americans represent around 6% of the U.S. population.[168] The lawsuit against Harvard was heard in Boston federal court in October 2018. On October 1, 2019, Judge Allison D. Burroughs rejected the plaintiffs\\' claims, ruling that Harvard\\'s admissions practices meet constitutional requirements and do not discriminate against Asian Americans.[169] SFFA filed an appeal in the First Circuit Court of Appeals, which sided with the university.[32][170] \\n In June 2023, on further appeal, a majority of the Supreme Court actually found in favor of SFFA, ruling that the practice was unconstitutional and that when favoring black and Hispanic applicants the university did disadvantage Asian applicants in the admissions process as the process was a \"zero sum\" game where the granting of preferences to some minorities due to their race necessarily disadvantaged others because of their race. \\n In August 2020, the US Department of Justice notified Yale University of its findings that Yale illegally discriminates against Asian American and white applicants and demanded Yale cease using race or national origin in its upcoming 2020–2021 undergraduate admissions cycles.[171]  Yale has issued a statement viewing the allegation as \"baseless\" and \"rushed\" and \"will not change its admissions processes in response to today\\'s letter because the DOJ is seeking to impose a standard that is inconsistent with existing law\".[172]\\n Numerous myths and misperceptions regarding affirmative actions shape public opinion on the issue.[173] These misperceptions often shape public opinion on specific cases'),\n",

For example, in Students for Fair Admissions, the conflation of two separate issues—Harvard University\\'s affirmative action policy and specific claims of discrimination by Harvard University – colors some people\\'s judgements on affirmative action as a whole.[163] Such conflation allows \"longstanding myths about affirmative action and socially salient racial stereotypes concerning who does, and does not, belong in elite institutions of higher education\" to prosper.[163] Hence, it is often difficult for public opinion polls on cases, let alone the general issue of affirmative action, to be unaffected by such myths.\\n \\n Racial quotas in college admissions \\n [edit] The use of affirmative action in higher education has been debated countless of times during college admissions seasons, especially due to the mismatch effect. Though it creates opportunities for people of color and for people of minority groups to access higher education, many public universities, have been attacked for depending on racial quotas, implemented through affirmative action policies, to reach diversity goals. This has prompted for high-profile lawsuits and Supreme Court rulings based on arguments of reverse racism or discrimination that prevents admissions to \"more qualified\" white students to take place.[174] Consequently, these cases have constantly reshaped the view on affirmative action policies by referring to it, in its original sense, a race-conscious policy, which ultimately obliges the inclusion of people of minority groups in higher education.[175] Most importantly, it has questioned whether or not affirmative action is effective in achieving numerical goals while avoiding preferential treatment, where many[who?] have deemed it a form of \"reverse discrimination.\"[176]\\n \\n Bakke v. Regents of the University of California \\n [edit] In 1974, the California Supreme Court ruled that UC Davis violated the Equal Protection Clause and the Civil Rights Act because they were relying on racial quotas heavily.[177] Allen Bakke was a thirty-five-year-old man who applied to UC Davis medical school in two consecutive years, but was rejected both times.[177] This was because UC Davis had a special admission affirmative action program that reserved 16 spots for minority students, out of 100 admission slots, which Bakke argued was the reason he was rejected twice from the medical program despite having a high GPA and MCAT score.[177] In this special program, mostly run by members from minority groups, applicants who were considered disadvantaged did not have to meet the 2.5 grade point average minimum that the'),\n",

It is likely that survey design, the framing of the survey question itself, and other factors may have significant effects on the survey results. The following polls only discuss affirmative action in higher education.  In general, \"affirmative action\" is supported by the general public, but \"considerations based on race\" are opposed.\\n In a survey conducted by Gallup in 2013,[182] 67% of U.S. adults believed college admission should be solely based on merit. According to Gallup: \"One of the clearest examples of affirmative action in practice is colleges\\' taking into account a person\\'s racial or ethnic background when deciding which applicants will be admitted. Americans seem reluctant to endorse such a practice, and even blacks, who have historically been helped by such programs, are divided on the matter. Aside from African Americans, a majority of all other major subgroups believe colleges should determine admissions solely on merit.\"\\n In a national survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2014, among 3,335 Americans, 63% felt that affirmative action programs designed to increase the number of African American and minority students on college campuses are a good thing.[183]\\n In February 2019, Gallup published the results of a November and December 2018 survey and found that support for affirmative action programs was growing.[184] They polled 6,502 Americans.

Los Angeles will be the host city, with various events also scheduled to be held at other cities spread across the Greater Los Angeles area,[1] plus two subsites in Oklahoma City.[2]\\n Los Angeles had originally bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics. However, after multiple withdrawals that left only Los Angeles and Paris in contention, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved a process to concurrently award the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two remaining candidates; Paris displayed a preference for the 2024 Games, and Los Angeles agreed to host in 2028. Both of the bids were praised for high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities.[3] Los Angeles was formally awarded the Games at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru, on September 13, 2017. They will mark the fifth Summer Olympics (first since Atlanta 1996), and ninth Olympics overall, to be hosted by the United States. Having previously hosted the Summer Olympics in 1932 and 1984, Los Angeles becomes the third three-time host city after London (1908, 1948, 2012) and Paris (1900, 1924, 2024), and the first non-European city to do so.\\n After debuting in 2020 as optional events, skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing have been promoted to the Summer Olympics\\' \"core\" event program. Boxing, modern pentathlon, and weightlifting had been provisionally removed due to governance issues; modern pentathlon and weightlifting were later reinstated following reform efforts, with the former expected to employ a new format replacing show jumping with obstacle course racing, while the decision on boxing was postponed. The 2028 Games will feature the debut of flag football and squash as optional sports, joined by the return of baseball/softball, cricket (for the first time since 1900) and lacrosse (for the first time since 1908).\\n \\n Bidding process \\n [edit] Bids for the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics On September 16, 2015, the International Olympic Committee announced the candidature process and the five candidate cities for the 2024 Games: Budapest, Hamburg, Los Angeles, Paris, and Rome.[4] Budapest, Hamburg, and Rome eventually withdrew, leaving only Los Angeles'),\n",

On April 3, 2017, at the IOC convention in Denmark, Olympic officials met with bid committees from Los Angeles and Paris to discuss the possibility of naming two winners in the competition to host the 2024 Summer Games.\\n After these withdrawals, the IOC Executive Board met in Lausanne, Switzerland, on June 9, 2017, to discuss the 2024 and 2028 bid processes.[6] The IOC formally proposed electing the 2024 and 2028 host cities at the same time in 2017, a proposal that an Extraordinary IOC Session approved on July 11, 2017, in Lausanne. The IOC set up a process where the Los Angeles and Paris 2024 bid committees and the IOC held meetings in July 2017 to decide which city would host in each of the two years.[7]\\n Following the decision to award the 2024 and 2028 Games simultaneously, Paris was understood to be preferred for the 2024 Games to mark the centennial of the 1924 Summer Olympics. On July 31, 2017, the IOC announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for 2028, with $1.8 billion of additional funding from the IOC,[8] allowing Paris to be confirmed as the host for 2024. On August 11, 2017, the Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously to approve the bid.[9] On September 11, 2017, Los Angeles received formal approval from the IOC's evaluation commission.[10] On September 13, 2017, Los Angeles was formally awarded the 2028 Games following a unanimous vote by the IOC.[11] The IOC praised the LA bid for using a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities and for relying entirely on corporate funding.[12][13]\\n On October 16, 2017, Los Angeles 2028 received official endorsement from the state of California.[14] On August 29, 2018, Olympic officials arrived for a two-day visit that included meetings with local organizers and a tour of the city's newest venues.[15] At the time, LMU and LA Times polls stated that more than 88% of Angelenos were in favor of the city hosting the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games.[16] In March 2023, a poll conducted by Suffolk\"),\n",

In August 2024, Mayor Karen Bass announced that LA plans the Olympics to be car-free, also termed '[public] transit-first' by organizers.[19] Promoting public transit as an alternative to driving is intended to reduce congestion and travel times. In addition to physical and organizational improvement of the city's own public transit infrastructure, Bass also suggested strategies such as encouraging remote work.[20][21]\\n The K Line opened to revenue service on October 7, 2022, after multiple delays from a planned opening in 2019.[22][23] It links the Crenshaw District, Inglewood and Westchester. The K Line will also connect to a people mover being constructed since early 2018 to link Los Angeles International Airport with the LAX/Metro Transit Center station, with opening anticipated in January 2026.[24][25][26] The Inglewood Transit Connector is another people mover planned to provide transportation between the K line and the Olympic venues in Inglewood.[27]\\n While various infrastructure improvements were planned regardless of the outcome of the Los Angeles Olympic bid, the extension of the Metro D Line will be expedited to serve the Olympics. Three phases were created to extend the line. The first phase will extend the D Line from the Wilshire/Western station to the new Wilshire/La Cienega station. This phase will be completed by 2025. The second phase will extend the D Line to Century City by 2026, while the third and final phase will extend the line to the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center in Westwood with a completion date set for 2027.

The project connected the Metro E Line, which already links venues in downtown Santa Monica to venues at Exposition Park and in downtown Los Angeles, to the southern half of the former Metro L Line. This allows for direct rail service between Santa Monica and East Los Angeles. The Regional Connector also linked the Metro A Line with the northern half of the Metro L Line, connecting the Long Beach area and San Gabriel Valley via downtown.[32][33] Also, the construction of the San Dimas station on the A Line extension will service Bonelli Park, home of mountain bike events.[34]\\n These infrastructure improvements, among others, are being funded by Measure R, a temporary half-cent sales tax increase, and Measure M, a continuation of Measure R's tax increase plus an additional permanent half-cent sales tax increase, both tax measures applicable to Los Angeles County.[35] Measure R was approved by voters in November 2008 and Measure M was approved by voters in November 2016. Both tax measures are unrelated to the Olympics and passed by voters prior to the Olympic Games being awarded.[35]\\n \\n Bus fleet \\n [edit]  LA28 organizers estimate Los Angeles will need an extra 2,700 buses to move spectators and athletes during events, doubling Metro's current fleet. The organizers anticipate LA Metro to meet the demand and stated they support Metro in their transportation infrastructure development plans.[36] Metro reports it would take an estimated $700 million to $1 billion to cover the cost.[37] Through the Vision 2028 plan, they are applying for federal grants and identifying other nationwide agencies in need of new fleet buses after the games to streamline re-sale.[38]\\n \\n Budget \\n [edit] In April 2019, the estimated cost of the Games was assessed as being approximately $6.88 billion, with all the money coming from the private sector. The organizers adjusted the budget for inflation after LA, which originally bid for the 2024 Games, agreed to wait four more years.[39][40]\\n The City of Los Angeles is the lead public guarantor, committing to spend up to $250 million to cover shortfalls.

LA 2024 also agreed to purchase a wide range of insurance policies to cover financial relief in the event of natural disaster, terrorism, event cancellation, as well as reduced ticket sales. The Games are expected to generate as much as they cost, with $2.5 billion coming in through sponsorships and nearly $2 billion earned through ticket sales. Average ticket prices for the Games will range between $13 and $457 (in 2016 dollars).[40]\\n \\n Security \\n [edit] Security will be handled by the U.S. federal government with an agreement signed by the LA organizing committee and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in February 2020, but it will not be involved in the Games\\' funding, covering only the aforementioned security costs.[41]\\n The Olympics are the second to take place in the United States since September 11, 2001. Like the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, which took place five months after that attack, the DHS has designated the Olympics a National Special Security Event (NSSE). Therefore, the U.S. Secret Service is in charge of security. In this capacity, the Secret Service will head a single chain of command.[40]\\n \\n Venues \\n [edit] Venues of the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympics   Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum SoFi Stadium Like the 1984 Summer Olympics, the 2028 Summer Olympics will be hosted in a majority of venues around Greater Los Angeles. The city\\'s bid relied on a majority of existing venues and venues that had already been under construction or were planned regardless of the Games. The majority of venues are divided into clusters known as \"sports parks\", situated in Downtown Los Angeles, the San Fernando Valley, Carson (at California State University, Dominguez Hills), and Long Beach. No new permanent venues are being built specifically for the Games. Like the 1984 Summer Games, the Olympic Village will be situated on the University of California, Los Angeles campus, while the University of Southern California will host the Media Village.[42][43][44][45]\\n The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl will host athletics and football (soccer), respectively.[46] Both will become the first stadiums to have ever hosted three different Olympiads.[47][48] Crypto.com Arena will host gymnastics, and Intuit Dome will host basketball.['),\n",

The plans called the final leg of the torch relay to be ceremonially launched from the Coliseum, a simulcast of the opening ceremony proper at SoFi Stadium for those in attendance, and the ceremonial re-lighting of the historic Olympic cauldron at the stadium once the cauldron is lit in Inglewood. The closing ceremony would be held in reverse, with opening segments at SoFi Stadium, and the official protocol held at the Coliseum.[59]\\n To reduce costs and use more pre-existing facilities, LA28 announced changes to its venue plans in June 2024. The temporary aquatics center that was scheduled to be built at USC's Dedeaux Field was scrapped, in favor of holding swimming at SoFi Stadium, artistic swimming in Long Beach, and diving at the historic Los Angeles Swim Stadium (which was built for the 1932 Games). With a planned configuration for 38,000 spectators, SoFi Stadium will be the largest swimming venue in Olympic history.

These Games will introduce changes to the program of core Olympic sports, including the permanent addition of skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing after having been featured as optional sports in 2020 and 2024. These sports were intended by the IOC to replace boxing, modern pentathlon, and weightlifting, which had all been placed under provisional status due to governance issues.[60] Modern pentathlon and weightlifting were later reinstated, but boxing remains under provisional status until further notice due to unresolved concerns.[61][62] The Los Angeles 2028 Organizing Committee proposed five optional sports: baseball/softball, cricket, flag football, lacrosse, and squash. They were approved by the IOC in October 2023 as part of their policy of introducing Games-specific sports to maximize local interest and growth.[63][64]\\n Of the 16 new disciplines proposed by existing Olympic sports, beach sprint rowing was the only one to be accepted by the IOC. It will replace the lightweight double sculls category, and consist of individual events for men and women as well as a mixed double sculls event.[65] Proposed disciplines which were not ultimately selected included compound archery.[66] Modern pentathlon is expected to employ a new format which replaces show jumping with obstacle course racing.[62]\\n Aquatics\\n\\xa0Artistic swimming (2)\\n\\xa0Diving (8)\\n\\xa0Marathon swimming (2)\\n\\xa0Swimming (35)\\n\\xa0Water polo (2) \\xa0Archery (5)'),\n",

Governance concerns increased following the election of Umar Kremlev as its president in December 2020 due to his opposition to the independent appointment of judges and officials, and allegations of increasing Russian influence (including moving some of its operations to Russia, and his appointment of state-owned oil and gas company Gazprom as the organization\\'s main sponsor in 2021. The IBA had also stifled attempts by candidates to challenge Kremlev\\'s presidency, and lifted an IOC-recommended ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes (in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine) in October 2022.[72][73] A competing governing body known as World Boxing was established in April 2023 by a consortium of national federations that had expressed concerns over the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on the IBA, and over the future of boxing as an Olympic event. In June 2023, the IOC executive board voted to strip the IBA of its recognition, citing a lack of progress since the original suspension.[74][75][76][77] The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) faced issues with doping and governance, resulting in weightlifting being considered \"provisional\" for the 2024 Summer Olympics.[74] In 2022, the IWF elected Mohammed Hasan Jalood as its new president, and he oversaw reforms to the organization, including agreeing to delegate its drug testing to the International Testing Agency and to participate in the Court of Arbitration for Sport.[61][62] The Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM) was seeking approval for its proposed replacement of show jumping in the modern pentathlon with obstacle course racing;[70][78][79][80] the campaign to replace riding was motivated primarily by incidents during the women\\'s modern pentathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics, which saw German team coach Kim Raisner disqualified after she hit a horse that did not follow the instructions of jockey Annika Sch'),\n",

Track and field athletics events will take place during the first week of the Games instead, during which SoFi Stadium will be reconfigured to uncover the pool in preparation for swimming competition during the second week.[2]\\n \\n Marketing \\n [edit] \\n Emblem \\n [edit] On September 1, 2020, the LA28 OCOG unveiled the emblem for the 2028 Summer Olympics, featuring the characters \"LA\" and \"28\" in a stacked layout. The \"A\" in \"LA\" is designed to be interchangeable, with variations created in collaboration with American athletes, artists, designers, celebrities, and other figures (such as musician Billie Eilish, comedian Lilly Singh, and actress Reese Witherspoon). One variant is inspired by the \"Stars in Motion\" emblem of the 1984 Summer Olympics.[84] Following the closing of the 2024 Games, another variation of the logo honoring Kobe Bryant was revealed on August 12, 2024.
